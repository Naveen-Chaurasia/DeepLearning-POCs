      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">We had read each other’s work but had never met, thanks to the thousands of miles that separate Barcelona from the capital of Japan. Then a mutual acquaintance put us in touch, launching a friendship that led to this project and seems destined to last a lifetime.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The next time we got together, a year later, we strolled through a park in downtown Tokyo and ended up talking about trends in Western psychology, specifically logotherapy, which helps people find their purpose in life.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">We remarked that Viktor Frankl’s logotherapy had gone <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_2\" title=\"2\"/>out of fashion among practicing therapists, who favored other schools of psychology, though people still search for meaning in what they do and how they live. We ask ourselves things like:</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">What is the meaning of my life?</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Is the point just to live longer, or should I seek a higher purpose?</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Why do some people know what they want and have a passion for life, while others languish in confusion?</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">At some point in our conversation, the mysterious word <em>ikigai</em> came up.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">This Japanese concept, which translates roughly as “the happiness of always being busy,” is like logotherapy, but it goes a step beyond. It also seems to be one way of explaining the extraordinary longevity of the Japanese, especially on the island of Okinawa, where there are 24.55 people over the age of 100 for every 100,000 inhabitants—far more than the global average.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Those who study why the inhabitants of this island in the south of Japan live longer than people anywhere else in the world believe that one of the keys—in addition to a healthful diet, a simple life in the outdoors, green tea, and the subtropical climate (its average temperature is like that of Hawaii)—is the <em>ikigai</em> that shapes their lives.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_3\" title=\"3\"/>While researching this concept, we discovered that not a single book in the fields of psychology or personal development is dedicated to bringing this philosophy to the West.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Is <em>ikigai</em> the reason there are more centenarians in Okinawa than anywhere else? How does it inspire people to stay active until the very end? What is the secret to a long and happy life?</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">As we explored the matter further, we discovered that one place in particular, Ogimi, a rural town on the north end of the island with a population of three thousand, boasts the highest life expectancy in the world—a fact that has earned it the nickname the Village of Longevity.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Okinawa is where most of Japan’s <em>shikuwasa</em>—a limelike fruit that packs an extraordinary antioxidant punch—comes from. Could that be Ogimi’s secret to long life? Or is it the purity of the water used to brew its Moringa tea?</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">We decided to go study the secrets of the Japanese centenarians in person. After a year of preliminary research we arrived in the village—where residents speak an ancient dialect and practice an animist religion that features long-haired forest sprites called bunagaya—with our cameras and recording devices in hand. As soon as we arrived we could sense the incredible friendliness of its residents, who laughed and joked incessantly amid lush green hills fed by crystalline waters.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_4\" title=\"4\"/>As we conducted our interviews with the eldest residents of the town, we realized that something far more powerful than just these natural resources was at work: an uncommon joy flows from its inhabitants and guides them through the long and pleasurable journey of their lives.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Again, the mysterious <em>ikigai</em>.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">But what is it, exactly? How do you get it?</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">It never ceased to surprise us that this haven of nearly eternal life was located precisely in Okinawa, where two hundred thousand innocent lives were lost at the end of World War II. Rather than harbor animosity toward outsiders, however, Okinawans live by the principle of <em>ichariba chode</em>, a local expression that means “treat everyone like a brother, even if you’ve never met them before.”</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">It turns out that one of the secrets to happiness of Ogimi’s residents is feeling like part of a community. From an early age they practice <em>yuimaaru</em>, or teamwork, and so are used to helping one another.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Nurturing friendships, eating light, getting enough rest, and doing regular, moderate exercise are all part of the equation of good health, but at the heart of the joie de vivre that inspires these centenarians to keep celebrating birthdays and cherishing each new day is their <em>ikigai</em>.</p>&#13;\n",

      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">Certain longevity studies suggest that a strong sense of community and a clearly defined <em>ikigai</em> are just as important as the famously healthful Japanese diet—perhaps even more so. Recent medical studies of centenarians from Okinawa <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_11\" title=\"11\"/>and other so-called Blue Zones—the geographic regions where people live longest—provide a number of interesting facts about these extraordinary human beings:</p>&#13;\n",

      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted-First\">Not only do they live much longer than the rest of the world’s population, they also suffer from fewer chronic illnesses such as cancer and heart disease; inflammatory disorders are also less common.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted\">Many of these centenarians enjoy enviable levels of vitality and health that would be unthinkable for people of advanced age elsewhere.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted\">Their blood tests reveal fewer free radicals (which are responsible for cellular aging), as a result of drinking tea and eating until their stomachs are only 80 percent full.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted\">Women experience more moderate symptoms during menopause, and both men and women maintain higher levels of sexual hormones until much later in life.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted-Last\">The rate of dementia is well below the global average.</li>&#13;\n",

      "\t\t\t</div>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Though we will consider each of these findings over the course of the book, research clearly indicates that the Okinawans’ focus on <em>ikigai</em> gives a sense of purpose to each and every day and plays an important role in their health and longevity.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-14\">The five Blue Zones</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">Okinawa holds first place among the world’s Blue Zones. In Okinawa, women in particular live longer and have fewer diseases than anywhere else in the world. The five regions identified and analyzed by Dan Buettner in his book <em>The Blue Zones</em> are:</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<ol>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Numbered-First\" value=\"1\"><em>Okinawa, Japan</em> (especially the northern part of the island). The locals eat a diet rich in vegetables and tofu typically served on small plates. In addition to their philosophy of <em>ikigai</em>, the <em>moai</em>, or close-knit group of friends (see page 15), plays an important role in their longevity.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Numbered\"><em>Sardinia, Italy</em> (specifically the provinces of Nuoro and Ogliastra). Locals on this island consume plenty of vegetables and one or two glasses of wine per day. As in Okinawa, the <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_13\" title=\"13\"/>cohesive nature of this community is another factor directly related to longevity.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Numbered\"><em>Loma Linda, California</em>. Researchers studied a group of Seventh-day Adventists who are among the longest-living people in the United States.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Numbered\"><em>The Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica</em>. Locals remain remarkably active after ninety; many of the region’s older residents have no problem getting up at five thirty in the morning to work in the fields.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Numbered-Last\"><em>Ikaria, Greece</em>. One of every three inhabitants of this island near the coast of Turkey is over ninety years old (compared to less than 1 percent of the population of the United States), a fact that has earned it the nickname the Island of Long Life. The local secret seems to be a lifestyle that dates back to 500 BC.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t</ol>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">In the following chapters, we will examine several factors that seem to be the keys to longevity and are found across the Blue Zones, paying special attention to Okinawa and its so-called Village of Longevity. First, however, it is worth pointing out that three of these regions are islands, where resources can be scarce and communities have to help one another.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">For many, helping others might be an <em>ikigai</em> strong enough to keep them alive.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">According to scientists who have studied the five Blue Zones, <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_14\" title=\"14\"/>the keys to longevity are diet, exercise, finding a purpose in life (an <em>ikigai</em>), and forming strong social ties—that is, having a broad circle of friends and good family relations.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Members of these communities manage their time well in order to reduce stress, consume little meat or processed foods, and drink alcohol in moderation.<a href=\"9781524704551_EPUB-24.xhtml#EndnoteNumber0\" id=\"SuperscriptNumber0\"><sup class=\"endnote\">1</sup></a></p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">They don’t do strenuous exercise, but they do move every day, taking walks and working in their vegetable gardens. People in the Blue Zones would rather walk than drive. Gardening, which involves daily low-intensity movement, is a practice almost all of them have in common.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-15\">The 80 percent secret</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">One of the most common sayings in Japan is “Hara hachi bu,” which is repeated before or after eating and means something like “Fill your belly to 80 percent.” Ancient wisdom advises against eating until we are full. This is why Okinawans stop eating when they feel their stomachs reach 80 percent of their capacity, rather than overeating and wearing down their bodies with long digestive processes that accelerate cellular oxidation.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Of course, there is no way to know objectively if your stomach is at 80 percent capacity. The lesson to learn from this saying is that we should stop eating when we are starting <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_15\" title=\"15\"/>to feel full. The extra side dish, the snack we eat when we know in our hearts we don’t really need it, the apple pie after lunch—all these will give us pleasure in the short term, but not having them will make us happier in the long term.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The way food is served is also important. By presenting their meals on many small plates, the Japanese tend to eat less. A typical meal in a restaurant in Japan is served in five plates on a tray, four of them very small and the main dish slightly bigger. Having five plates in front of you makes it seem like you are going to eat a lot, but what happens most of the time is that you end up feeling slightly hungry. This is one of the reasons why Westerners in Japan typically lose weight and stay trim.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Recent studies by nutritionists reveal that Okinawans consume a daily average of 1,800 to 1,900 calories, compared to 2,200 to 3,300 in the United States, and have a body mass index between 18 and 22, compared to 26 or 27 in the United States.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The Okinawan diet is rich in tofu, sweet potatoes, fish (three times per week), and vegetables (roughly 11 ounces per day). In the chapter dedicated to nutrition we will see which healthy, antioxidant-rich foods are included in this 80 percent.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-16\"><em>Moai</em>: Connected for life</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">It is customary in Okinawa to form close bonds within local communities. A <em>moai</em> is an informal group of people with <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_16\" title=\"16\"/>common interests who look out for one another. For many, serving the community becomes part of their <em>ikigai</em>.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The <em>moai</em> has its origins in hard times, when farmers would get together to share best practices and help one another cope with meager harvests.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Members of a <em>moai</em> make a set monthly contribution to the group. This payment allows them to participate in meetings, dinners, games of go and <em>shogi</em> (Japanese chess), or whatever hobby they have in common.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The funds collected by the group are used for activities, but if there is money left over, one member (decided on a rotating basis) receives a set amount from the surplus. In this way, being part of a <em>moai </em>helps maintain emotional and financial stability. If a member of a <em>moai</em> is in financial trouble, he or she can get an advance from the group’s savings. While the details of each <em>moai</em>’s accounting practices vary according to the group and its economic means, the feeling of belonging and support gives the individual a sense of security and helps increase life expectancy.</p>&#13;\n",

      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">A colleague once asked Viktor Frankl to define his school of psychology in a single phrase, to which Frankl replied, “Well, in logotherapy the patient sits up straight and has to listen to things that are, on occasion, hard to hear.” The colleague had just described psychoanalysis to him in the following terms: “In psychoanalysis, the patient lies down on a couch and tells you things that are, on occasion, hard to say.”</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Frankl explains that one of the first questions he would ask his patients was “Why do you not commit suicide?” Usually the patient found good reasons not to, and was able to carry on.

      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">Existential frustration arises when our life is without purpose, or when that purpose is skewed. In Frankl’s view, however, there is no need to see this frustration as an anomaly or a symptom of neurosis; instead, it can be a positive thing—a catalyst for change.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Logotherapy does not see this frustration as <em>mental illness</em>, the way other forms of therapy do, but rather as <em>spiritual anguish—</em>a natural and beneficial phenomenon that drives those who suffer from it to seek a cure, whether on their own or with the help of others, and in so doing to find greater satisfaction in life. It helps them change their own destiny.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Logotherapy enters the picture if the person needs help doing this, if he needs guidance in discovering his life’s purpose and later in overcoming conflicts so he can keep moving toward his objective. In <em>Man’s Search for Meaning</em>, Frankl cites one of Nietzsche’s famous aphorisms: “He who has a <em>why</em> to live for can bear with almost any <em>how</em>.”</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Based on his own experience, Frankl believed that our health depends on that natural tension that comes from comparing what we’ve accomplished so far with what we’d like to achieve in the future. What we need, then, is not a peaceful existence, but a challenge we can strive to meet by applying all the skills at our disposal.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_41\" title=\"41\"/>Existential crisis, on the other hand, is typical of modern societies in which people do what they are told to do, or what others do, rather than what they want to do. They often try to fill the gap between what is expected of them and what they want for themselves with economic power or physical pleasure, or by numbing their senses. It can even lead to suicide.</p>&#13;\n",

      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">In the pages that follow, we will look at four cases from Frankl’s own practice in order to better understand the search for meaning and purpose.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-37\">Case study: Viktor Frankl</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">In German concentration camps, as in those that would later be built in Japan and Korea, psychiatrists confirmed that the prisoners with the greatest chance of survival were <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_43\" title=\"43\"/>those who had things they wanted to accomplish outside the camp, those who felt a strong need to get out of there alive. This was true of Frankl, who, after being released and successfully developing the school of logotherapy, realized he had been the first patient of his own practice.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Frankl had a goal to achieve, and it made him persevere. He arrived at Auschwitz carrying a manuscript that contained all the theories and research he had compiled over the course of his career, ready for publication. When it was confiscated, he felt compelled to write it all over again, and that need drove him and gave his life meaning amid the constant horror and doubt of the concentration camp—so much so that over the years, and especially when he fell ill with typhus, he would jot down fragments and key words from the lost work on any scrap of paper he found.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-38\">Case study: The American diplomat</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">An important North American diplomat went to Frankl to pick up where he left off with a course of treatment he had started five years earlier in the United States. When Frankl asked him why he’d started therapy in the first place, the diplomat answered that he hated his job and his country’s international policies, which he had to follow and enforce. His American psychoanalyst, whom he’d been seeing for years, <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_44\" title=\"44\"/>insisted he make peace with his father so that his government and his job, both representations of the paternal figure, would seem less disagreeable. Frankl, however, showed him in just a few sessions that his frustration was due to the fact that he wanted to pursue a different career, and the diplomat concluded his treatment with that idea in mind.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Five years later, the former diplomat informed Frankl that he had been working during that time in a different profession, and that he was happy.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">In Frankl’s view, the man not only didn’t need all those years of psychoanalysis, he also couldn’t even really be considered a “patient” in need of therapy. He was simply someone in search of a new life’s purpose; as soon as he found it, his life took on deeper meaning.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-39\">Case study: The suicidal mother</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">The mother of a boy who had died at age eleven was admitted to Frankl’s clinic after she tried to kill herself and her other son. It was this other son, paralyzed since birth, who kept her from carrying out her plan: He <em>did</em> believe his life had a purpose, and if his mother killed them both, it would keep him from achieving his goals.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The woman shared her story in a group session. To help her, Frankl asked another woman to imagine a hypothetical <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_45\" title=\"45\"/>situation in which she lay on her deathbed, old and wealthy but childless. The woman insisted that, in that case, she would have felt her life had been a failure.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">When the suicidal mother was asked to perform the same exercise, imagining herself on her deathbed, she looked back and realized that she had done everything in her power for her children—for both of them. She had given her paralyzed son a good life, and he had turned into a kind, reasonably happy person. To this she added, crying, “As for myself, I can look back peacefully on my life; for I can say my life was full of meaning, and I have tried hard to live it fully; I have done my best—I have done my best for my son. My life was no failure!”</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">In this way, by imagining herself on her deathbed and looking back, the suicidal mother found the meaning that, though she was not aware of it, her life already had.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-40\">Case study: The grief-stricken doctor</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">An elderly doctor, unable to overcome the deep depression into which he’d fallen after the death of his wife two years earlier, went to Frankl for help.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Instead of giving him advice or analyzing his condition, Frankl asked him what would have happened if he had been the one who died first. The doctor, horrified, answered that it would have been terrible for his poor wife, that she would <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_46\" title=\"46\"/>have suffered tremendously. To which Frankl responded, “You see, doctor? You have spared her all that suffering, but the price you have to pay for this is to survive, and mourn her.”</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The doctor didn’t say another word. He left Frankl’s office in peace, after taking the therapist’s hand in his own. He was able to tolerate the pain in place of his beloved wife. His life had been given a purpose.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-41\">Morita therapy</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">In the same decade that logotherapy came into being—a few years earlier, in fact—Shoma Morita created his own purpose-centered therapy, in Japan. It proved to be effective in the treatment of neurosis, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">In addition to being a psychotherapist, Shoma Morita was a Zen Buddhist, and his therapy left a lasting spiritual mark on Japan.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Many Western forms of therapy focus on controlling or modifying the patient’s emotions. In the West, we tend to believe that what we think influences how we feel, which in turn influences how we act. In contrast, Morita therapy focuses on teaching patients to <em>accept their emotions without trying to control them</em>, since their feelings will change <em>as a result of their actions</em>.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_47\" title=\"47\"/>In addition to accepting the patient’s emotions, Morita therapy seeks to “create” new emotions on the basis of actions. According to Morita, these emotions are learned through experience and repetition.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Morita therapy is not meant to eliminate symptoms; instead it teaches us to accept our desires, anxieties, fears, and worries, and let them go. As Morita writes in his book <em>Morita Therapy and the True Nature of Anxiety-Based Disorders</em>, “In feelings, it is best to be wealthy and generous.”</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Morita explained the idea of letting go of negative feelings with the following fable: A donkey that is tied to a post by a rope will keep walking around the post in an attempt to free itself, only to become more immobilized and attached to the post. The same thing applies to people with obsessive thinking who become more trapped in their own suffering when they try to escape from their fears and discomfort.<a href=\"9781524704551_EPUB-24.xhtml#EndnoteNumber7\" id=\"SuperscriptNumber7\"><sup class=\"endnote\">5</sup></a></p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h3 class=\"x05-Head-B\">The basic principles of Morita therapy</h3>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<ol>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Numbered-Para-First\" value=\"1\"><em>Accept your feelings</em>. If we have obsessive thoughts, we should not try to control them or get rid of them. If we do, they become more intense. Regarding human emotions, the Zen master would say, “If we try to get rid of one wave with another, we end up with an infinite sea.” We don’t create our feelings; they simply come to us, and we have to accept them. The trick is welcoming them. Morita likened emotions to the weather: <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_48\" title=\"48\"/>We can’t predict or control them; we can only observe them. To this point, he often quoted the Vietnamese monk Thich Nhat Hanh, who would say, “Hello, solitude. How are you today? Come, sit with me, and I will care for you.”<a href=\"9781524704551_EPUB-24.xhtml#EndnoteNumber8\" id=\"SuperscriptNumber8\"><sup class=\"endnote\">6</sup></a></li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Numbered-Para\"><em>Do what you should be doing</em>. We shouldn’t focus on eliminating symptoms, because recovery will come on its own. We should focus instead on the present moment, and if we are suffering, on accepting that suffering. Above all, we should avoid intellectualizing the situation. The therapist’s mission is to develop the patient’s character so he or she can face any situation, and character is grounded in the things we do. Morita therapy does not offer its patients explanations, but rather allows them to learn from their actions and activities. It doesn’t tell you how to meditate, or how to keep a diary the way Western therapies do. It is up to the patient to make discoveries through experience.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Numbered-Para\"><em>Discover your life’s purpose</em>. We can’t control our emotions, but we can take charge of our actions every day. This is why we should have a clear sense of our purpose, and always keep Morita’s mantra in mind: “What do we need to be doing right now? What action should we be taking?” The key to achieving this is having dared to look inside yourself to find your <em>ikigai</em>.<h3 class=\"x05-Head-B\">The four phases of Morita therapy</h3><p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">Morita’s original treatment, which lasts fifteen to twenty-one days, consists of the following stages:</p></li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t</ol>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<ol>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Numbered-Para-First\" value=\"1\"><em>Isolation and rest (five to seven days)</em>. During the first week of treatment, the patient rests in a room without any external stimuli. No television, books, family, friends, or speaking. All the patient has is his thoughts. He lies down for most of the day and is visited regularly by the therapist, who tries to avoid interacting with him as much as possible. The therapist simply advises the patient to continue observing the rise and fall of his emotions as he lies there. When the patient gets bored and wants to start doing things again, he is ready to move on to the next stage of therapy.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Numbered-Para\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_49\" title=\"49\"/><em>Light occupational therapy (five to seven days)</em>. In this stage, the patient performs repetitive tasks in silence. One of these is keeping a diary about his thoughts and feelings. The patient goes outside after a week of being shut in, takes walks in nature, and does breathing exercises. He also starts doing simple activities, such as gardening, drawing, or painting. During this stage, the patient is still not allowed to talk to anyone, except the therapist.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Numbered-Para\"><em>Occupational therapy (five to seven days)</em>. In this stage, the patient performs tasks that require physical movement. Dr. Morita liked to take his patients to the mountains to chop wood. In addition to physical tasks, the patient is also immersed in other activities, such as writing, painting, or making ceramics. The patient can speak with others at this stage, but only about the tasks at hand.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Numbered-Para\"><em>The return to social life and the “real” world</em>. The patient leaves the hospital and is reintroduced to social life, but maintains the practices of meditation and occupational therapy developed during treatment. The idea is to reenter society as a new person, with a sense of purpose, and without being controlled by social or emotional pressures.<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-42\">Naikan meditation</h2><p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">Morita was a great Zen master of Naikan introspective meditation. Much of his therapy draws on his knowledge and mastery of this school, which centers on three questions the individual must ask him- or herself:</p></li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t</ol>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<ol>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Numbered-First\" value=\"1\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_50\" title=\"50\"/>What have I received from person X?</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Numbered\">What have I given to person X?</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Numbered-Last\">What problems have I caused person X?</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t</ol>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Through these reflections, we stop identifying others as the cause of our problems and deepen our own sense of responsibility. As Morita said, “If you are angry and want to fight, think about it for three days before coming to blows. After three days, the intense desire to fight will pass on its own.”<a href=\"9781524704551_EPUB-24.xhtml#EndnoteNumber9\" id=\"SuperscriptNumber9\"><sup class=\"endnote\">7</sup></a></p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-43\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_51\" title=\"51\"/>And now, <em>ikigai</em></h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">Logotherapy and Morita therapy are both grounded in a personal, unique experience that you can access without therapists or spiritual retreats: the mission of finding your <em>ikigai</em>, your existential fuel. Once you find it, it is only a matter of having the courage and making the effort to stay on the right path.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">In the following chapters, we’ll take a look at the basic tools you’ll need to get moving along that path: finding flow in the tasks you’ve chosen to do, eating in a balanced and mindful way, doing low-intensity exercise, and learning not to give in when difficulties arise. In order to do this, you have to accept that the world—like the people who live in it—is imperfect, but that it is still full of opportunities for growth and achievement.</p>&#13;\n",

      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">Imagine you are skiing down one of your favorite slopes. Powdery snow flies up on both sides of you like white sand. Conditions are perfect.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">You are entirely focused on skiing as well as you can. You know exactly how to move at each moment. <em>There is no future, no past. There is only the present.</em> You feel the snow, your skis, your body, and your consciousness united as a single entity. <em>You are completely immersed in the experience, not thinking about or distracted by anything else. </em>Your ego dissolves, and you become part of what you are doing.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">This is the kind of experience Bruce Lee described with his famous “Be water, my friend.”</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">We’ve all felt our sense of time vanish when we lose ourselves in an activity we enjoy. We start cooking and before we know it, several hours have passed. We spend an afternoon with a book and forget about the world going by until we notice the sunset and realize we haven’t eaten dinner. We go surfing and don’t realize how many hours we have spent in the water until the next day, when our muscles ache.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_56\" title=\"56\"/>The opposite can also happen. When we have to complete a task we don’t want to do, every minute feels like a lifetime and we can’t stop looking at our watch. As the quip attributed to Einstein goes, “Put your hand on a hot stove for a minute and it seems like an hour. Sit with a pretty girl for an hour, and it seems like a minute. That is relativity.”</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The funny thing is that someone else might really enjoy the same task, but we want to finish as quickly as possible.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">What makes us enjoy doing something so much that we forget about whatever worries we might have while we do it? When are we happiest? These questions can help us discover our <em>ikigai</em>.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-48\">The power of flow</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">These questions are also at the heart of psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s research into the experience of being completely immersed in what we are doing. Csikszentmihalyi called this state “flow,” and described it as the pleasure, delight, creativity, and process when we are completely immersed in life.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">There is no magic recipe for finding happiness, for living according to your <em>ikigai</em>, but one key ingredient is the ability to reach this state of flow and, through this state, to have an “optimal experience.”</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_57\" title=\"57\"/>In order to achieve this optimal experience, we have to focus on increasing the time we spend on activities that bring us to this state of flow, rather than allowing ourselves to get caught up in activities that offer immediate pleasure—like eating too much, abusing drugs or alcohol, or stuffing ourselves with chocolate in front of the TV.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">As Csikszentmihalyi asserts in his book <em>Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience</em>, flow is “the state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it.”</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">It is not only creative professionals who require the high doses of concentration that promote flow. Most athletes, chess players, and engineers also spend much of their time on activities that bring them to this state.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">According to Csikszentmihalyi’s research, a chess player feels the same way upon entering a state of flow as a mathematician working on a formula or a surgeon performing an operation. A professor of psychology, Csikszentmihalyi analyzed data from people around the world and discovered that flow is the same among individuals of all ages and cultures. In New York and Okinawa, we all reach a state of flow in the same way.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">But what happens to our mind when we are in that state?</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">When we flow, we are focused on a concrete task without <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_58\" title=\"58\"/>any distractions. Our mind is “in order.” The opposite occurs when we try to do something while our mind is on other things.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">If you often find yourself losing focus while working on something you consider important, there are several strategies you can employ to increase your chances of achieving flow.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<div class=\"Sidebar-Grey\"><h2 class=\"x10-Sidebar-Title\">The Seven Conditions for Achieving Flow</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x10-Sidebar-Body-Text-First\">According to researcher Owen Schaffer of DePaul University, the requirements for achieving flow are:</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<ol>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x10-Sidebar-List-Numbered-First\">Knowing what to do</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x10-Sidebar-List-Numbered\">Knowing how to do it</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x10-Sidebar-List-Numbered\">Knowing how well you are doing</li>&#13;\n",

      "\t\t\t</div>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-49\">Strategy 1: Choose a difficult task (but not too difficult!)</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">Schaffer’s model encourages us to take on tasks that we have a chance of completing but that are slightly outside our comfort zone.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_59\" title=\"59\"/>Every task, sport, or job has a set of rules, and we need a set of skills to follow them. If the rules for completing a task or achieving a purpose are too basic relative to our skill set, we will likely get bored. Activities that are too easy lead to apathy.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">If, on the other hand, we assign ourselves a task that is too difficult, we won’t have the skills to complete it and will almost certainly give up—and feel frustrated, to boot.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The ideal is to find a middle path, something aligned with our abilities but just a bit of a stretch, so we experience it as a challenge. This is what Ernest Hemingway meant when he said, “Sometimes I write better than I can.”<a href=\"9781524704551_EPUB-24.xhtml#EndnoteNumber11\" id=\"SuperscriptNumber11\"><sup class=\"endnote\">2</sup></a></p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">We want to see challenges through to the end because we enjoy the feeling of pushing ourselves. Bertrand Russell expressed a similar idea when he said, “To be able to concentrate for a considerable amount of time is essential to difficult achievement.”<a href=\"9781524704551_EPUB-24.xhtml#EndnoteNumber12\" id=\"SuperscriptNumber12\"><sup class=\"endnote\">3</sup></a></p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">If you’re a graphic designer, learn a new software program for your next project. If you’re a programmer, use a new programming language. If you’re a dancer, try to incorporate into your next routine a movement that has seemed impossible for years.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Add a little something extra, something that takes you out of your comfort zone.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Even doing something as simple as reading means following certain rules, having certain abilities and knowledge. If <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_60\" title=\"60\"/>we set out to read a book on quantum mechanics for specialists in physics without being specialists in physics ourselves, we’ll probably give up after a few minutes. On the other end of the spectrum, if we already know everything a book has to tell us, we’ll get bored right away.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">However, if the book is appropriate to our knowledge and abilities, and builds on what we already know, we’ll immerse ourselves in our reading, and time will flow. This pleasure and satisfaction are evidence that we are in tune with our <em>ikigai</em>.</p>&#13;\n",

      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">Video games—played in moderation—board games, and sports are great ways to achieve flow, because the objective tends to be very clear: Beat your rival or your own record while following a set of explicitly defined rules.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Unfortunately, the objective isn’t quite as clear in most situations.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">According to a study by Boston Consulting Group, when <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_61\" title=\"61\"/>asked about their bosses, the number one complaint of employees at multinational corporations is that they don’t “communicate the team’s mission clearly,” and that, as a result, the employees don’t know what their objectives are.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">What often happens, especially in big companies, is that the executives get lost in the details of obsessive planning, creating strategies to hide the fact that they don’t have a clear objective. It’s like heading out to sea with a map but no destination.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">It is much more important to have a compass pointing to a concrete objective than to have a map. Joi Ito, director of the MIT Media Lab, encourages us to use the principle of “compass over maps” as a tool to navigate our world of uncertainty. In the book <em>Whiplash: How to Survive Our Faster Future</em>, he and Jeff Howe write, “In an increasingly unpredictable world moving ever more quickly, a detailed map may lead you deep into the woods at an unnecessarily high cost. A good compass, though, will always take you where you need to go. It doesn’t mean that you should start your journey without any idea where you’re going. What it does mean is understanding that while the path to your goal may not be straight, you’ll finish faster and more efficiently than you would have if you had trudged along a preplanned route.”</p>&#13;\n",

      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">This is perhaps one of the greatest obstacles we face today, with so much technology and so many distractions. We’re <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_64\" title=\"64\"/>listening to a video on YouTube while writing an e-mail, when suddenly a chat prompt pops up and we answer it. Then our smartphone vibrates in our pocket; just as soon as we respond to that message, we’re back at our computer, logging on to Facebook.</p>&#13;\n",

      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">We often think that combining tasks will save us time, but scientific evidence shows that it has the opposite effect. Even those who claim to be good at multitasking are not very productive. In fact, they are some of the least productive people.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Our brains can take in millions of bits of information but can only actually process a few dozen per second. When we say we’re multitasking, what we’re really doing is <em>switching back and forth</em> between tasks very quickly. Unfortunately, we’re not computers adept at parallel processing. We end up spending all our energy alternating between tasks, instead of focusing on doing one of them well.</p>&#13;\n",

      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Technology is great, if we’re in control of it. It’s not so great if it takes control of us. For example, if you have to write a research paper, you might sit down at your computer and use Google to look up the information you need. However, if you’re not very disciplined, you might end up surfing the Web instead of writing that paper. In that case, Google and the Internet will have taken over, pulling you out of your state of flow.</p>&#13;\n",

      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Several studies conducted at Stanford University by Clifford Ivar Nass describe our generation as suffering from an <em>epidemic of multitasking</em>. One such study analyzed the behavior of hundreds of students, dividing them into groups based on the number of things they tended to do at once. The students who were the most addicted to multitasking typically alternated among more than four tasks; for example, taking notes while reading a textbook, listening to a podcast, answering messages <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_66\" title=\"66\"/>on their smartphone, and sometimes checking their Twitter timeline.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Each group of students was shown a screen with several red and several blue arrows. The objective of the exercise was to count the red arrows.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">At first, all the students answered correctly right away, without much trouble. As the number of blue arrows increased (the number of red arrows stayed the same; only their position changed), however, the students accustomed to multitasking had serious trouble counting the red arrows in the time allotted, or as quickly as the students who did not habitually multitask, for one very simple reason: They got distracted by the blue arrows! Their brains were trained to pay attention to every stimulus, regardless of its importance, while the brains of the other students were trained to focus on a single task—in this case, counting the red arrows and ignoring the blue ones.<a href=\"9781524704551_EPUB-24.xhtml#EndnoteNumber14\" id=\"SuperscriptNumber14\"><sup class=\"endnote\">5</sup></a></p>&#13;\n",

      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">What do <em>takumis</em> (artisans), engineers, inventors, and <em>otakus</em> (fans of anime and manga) have in common? They all understand the importance of flowing with their <em>ikigai</em> at all times.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">One widespread stereotype about people in Japan is that they’re exceptionally dedicated and hardworking, even though some Japanese people say they look like they’re working harder than they really are. There is no doubt, though, about their ability to be completely absorbed in a task, or about their perseverance when there is a problem to be solved. One of the first words one learns when starting Japanese lessons is <em>ganbaru</em>, which means “to persevere” or “to stay firm by doing one’s best.”</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Japanese people often apply themselves to even the most basic tasks with an intensity that borders on obsession. We <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_71\" title=\"71\"/>see this in all kinds of contexts, from the “retirees” taking meticulous care of their rice fields in the mountains of Nagano to the college students working the weekend shift in convenience stores known as <em>konbinis</em>. If you go to Japan, you’ll experience this attention to detail firsthand in almost every transaction.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Walk into one of the stores that sell handcrafted objects in Naha, Kanazawa, or Kyoto and you’ll also discover that Japan is a treasure trove of traditional craftwork. The people of Japan have a unique talent for creating new technologies while preserving artisanal traditions and techniques.</p>&#13;\n",

      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">Toyota employs “artisans” who are able to make a certain type of screw by hand. These <em>takumi</em>, or experts in a particular manual skill, are extremely important to Toyota, and they are hard to replace. Some of them are the only people who know how to perform their exact skill, and it doesn’t seem as though a new generation is going to take up the mantle.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Turntable needles are another example: They’re produced almost exclusively in Japan, where you can find the last remaining people who know how to use the machinery required to make these precision needles, and who are trying to pass on their knowledge to their descendants.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_72\" title=\"72\"/>We met a <em>takumi</em> on a visit to Kumano, a small town near Hiroshima. We were there for the day, working on a photo essay for one of the most famous brands of makeup brushes in the West. The billboard welcoming visitors to Kumano shows a mascot holding a large brush. In addition to the brush factories, the town is full of little houses and vegetable gardens; heading farther in, you can see several Shinto shrines at the base of the mountains that surround the town.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">We spent hours taking photos in factories full of people in orderly rows, each doing a single task—such as painting the handles of the brushes or loading boxes of them onto trucks—before we realized we still hadn’t seen anyone actually putting bristles into the brush heads.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">After we asked about this and got the runaround several times, the president of one company agreed to show us how it was done. He led us out of the building and asked us to get into his car. After a five-minute drive we parked next to another, smaller structure and climbed the stairs. He opened a door and we walked into a small room filled with windows that let in lovely natural light.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">In the middle of the room was a woman wearing a mask. You could see only her eyes. She was so focused on choosing individual bristles for the brushes—gracefully moving her hands and fingers, using scissors and combs to sort the bristles—that she didn’t even notice our presence. Her <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_73\" title=\"73\"/>movements were so quick it was hard to tell what she was doing.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The president of the company interrupted her to let her know that we’d be taking photos as she worked. We couldn’t see her mouth, but the glint in her eye and the cheerful inflection in her speech let us know she was smiling. She looked happy and proud talking about her work and responsibilities.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">We had to use extremely fast shutter speeds to capture her movements. Her hands danced and <em>flowed</em> in concert with her tools and the bristles she was sorting.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The president told us that this <em>takumi</em> was one of the most important people in the company, even though she was hidden away in a separate building. Every bristle of every brush the company made passed through her hands.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-54\">Steve Jobs in Japan</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">Apple cofounder Steve Jobs was a big fan of Japan. Not only did he visit the Sony factories in the 1980s and adopt many of their methods when he founded Apple, he was also captivated by the simplicity and quality of Japanese porcelain in Kyoto.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">It was not, however, an artisan from Kyoto who won Steve Jobs’s devotion, but rather a <em>takumi</em> from Toyama named Yukio Shakunaga, who used a technique called <em>Etchu Seto-yaki</em>, known by only a few.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_74\" title=\"74\"/>On a visit to Kyoto, Jobs heard of an exhibition of Shakunaga’s work. He immediately understood that there was something special about Shakunaga’s porcelain. As a matter of fact, he bought several cups, vases, and plates, and went back to the show three times that week.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Jobs returned to Kyoto several times over the course of his life in search of inspiration, and ended up meeting Shakunaga in person. It is said that Jobs had many questions for him—almost all of them about the fabrication process and the type of porcelain he used.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Shakunaga explained that he used white porcelain he extracted himself from mountains in the Toyama prefecture, making him the only artist of his ilk familiar with the fabrication process of porcelain objects from their origins in the mountains to their final form—an authentic <em>takumi</em>.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Jobs was so impressed that he considered going to Toyama to see the mountain where Shakunaga got his porcelain, but thought better of it when he heard that it was more than four hours by train from Kyoto.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">In an interview after Jobs’s death, Shakunaga said he was very proud that his work had been appreciated by the man who created the iPhone. He added that Jobs’s last purchase from him had been a set of twelve teacups. Jobs had asked for something special, “a new style.” To satisfy this request, Shakunaga made 150 teacups in the process of testing out <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_75\" title=\"75\"/>new ideas. Of these, he chose the twelve best and sent them to the Jobs family.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Ever since his first trip to Japan, Jobs was fascinated and inspired by the country’s artisans, engineers (especially at Sony), philosophy (especially Zen), and cuisine (especially sushi).<a href=\"9781524704551_EPUB-24.xhtml#EndnoteNumber16\" id=\"SuperscriptNumber16\"><sup class=\"endnote\">7</sup></a></p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-55\">Sophisticated simplicity</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">What do Japanese artisans, engineers, Zen philosophy, and cuisine have in common? Simplicity and attention to detail. It is not a lazy simplicity but a sophisticated one that searches out new frontiers, always taking the object, the body and mind, or the cuisine to the next level, according to one’s <em>ikigai</em>.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">As Csikszentmihalyi would say, the key is always having a meaningful challenge to overcome in order to maintain flow.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The documentary <em>Jiro Dreams of Sushi</em> gives us another example of a <em>takumi</em>, this time in the kitchen. Its protagonist has been making sushi every day for more than eighty years, and owns a small sushi restaurant near the Ginza subway station in Tokyo. He and his son go every day to the famous Tsukiji fish market and choose the best fish to bring back to the restaurant.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">In the documentary, we see one of Jiro’s apprentices learning to make tamago (a thin, slightly sweet omelet). No matter how hard he tries, he can’t get Jiro’s approval. He keeps practicing for years until he finally does.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_76\" title=\"76\"/>Why does the apprentice refuse to give up? Doesn’t he get bored cooking eggs every day? No, because making sushi is his <em>ikigai</em>, too<em>.</em></p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Both Jiro and his son are culinary artists. They don’t get bored when they cook—they achieve a state of flow. They enjoy themselves completely when they are in the kitchen; that is their happiness, their <em>ikigai.</em> They’ve learned to take pleasure in their work, to lose their sense of time.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Beyond the close relationship between father and son, which helps them keep the challenge going each day, they also work in a quiet, peaceful environment that allows them to concentrate. Even after receiving a three-star rating from Michelin, they never considered opening other locations or expanding the business. They serve just ten patrons at a time at the bar of their small restaurant. Jiro’s family isn’t looking to make money; instead they value good working conditions and creating an environment in which they can flow while making the best sushi in the world.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Jiro, like Yukio Shakunaga, begins his work at “the source.” He goes to the fish market to find the best tuna; Shakunaga goes to the mountains to find the best porcelain. When they get down to work, both become one with the object they are creating. This unity with the object that they reach in a state of flow takes on special meaning in Japan, <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_77\" title=\"77\"/>where, according to Shintoism, forests, trees, and objects have a <em>kami</em> (spirit or god) within them.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">When someone—whether an artist, an engineer, or a chef—sets out to create something, his or her responsibility is to use nature to give it “life” while respecting that nature at every moment. During this process, the artisan becomes one with the object and flows with it. An ironworker would say that metal has a life of its own, just as someone making ceramics would say that the clay does. The Japanese are skilled at bringing nature and technology together: not man versus nature, but rather a union of the two.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-56\">The purity of Ghibli</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">There are those who say that the Shinto value of being connected with nature is vanishing. One of the harshest critics of this loss is another artist with a clearly defined <em>ikigai</em>: Hayao Miyazaki, the director of the animated films produced by Studio Ghibli.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">In nearly all his films we see humans, technology, fantasy, and nature in a state of conflict—and, in the end, coming together. One of the most poignant metaphors in his film <em>Spirited Away</em> is an obese spirit covered in trash that represents the pollution of the rivers.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_78\" title=\"78\"/>In Miyazaki’s films, forests have personalities, trees have feelings, and robots befriend birds. Considered a national treasure by the Japanese government, Miyazaki is an artist capable of becoming completely absorbed in his art. He uses a cell phone from the late 1990s, and he makes his entire team draw by hand. He “directs” his films by rendering on paper even the tiniest detail, achieving flow by drawing, not by using a computer. Thanks to this obsession on the director’s part, Studio Ghibli is one of the only studios in the world where almost the entire production process is carried out using traditional techniques.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Those who have visited Studio Ghibli know that it is fairly typical, on a given Sunday to see a solitary individual tucked away in a corner, hard at work—a man in simple clothes who will greet them with an <em>ohayo</em> (hello) without looking up.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Miyazaki is so passionate about his work that he spends many Sundays in the studio, enjoying the state of flow, putting his <em>ikigai</em> above all else. Visitors know that under no circumstances is one to bother Miyazaki, who is known for his quick temper—especially if he is interrupted while drawing.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">In 2013, Miyazaki announced he was going to retire. To commemorate his retirement, the television station NHK made a documentary showing him in his last days at work. He is drawing in nearly every scene of the film. In one scene, several of his colleagues are seen coming out of a meeting, and there he is, drawing in a corner, paying no attention to them. In <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_79\" title=\"79\"/>another scene, he is shown walking to work on December 30 (a national holiday in Japan) and opening the doors of Studio Ghibli so he can spend the day there, drawing alone.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Miyazaki can’t stop drawing. The day after his “retirement,” instead of going on vacation or staying at home, he went to Studio Ghibli and sat down to draw. His colleagues put on their best poker faces, not knowing what to say. One year later, he announced he wouldn’t make any more feature films but that he would keep on drawing until the day he died.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Can someone really retire if he is passionate about what he does?</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-57\">The recluses</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">It is not only the Japanese who have this capacity; there are artists and scientists all over the world with strong, clear <em>ikigais</em>. They do what they love until their dying day.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The last thing Einstein wrote before closing his eyes forever was a formula that attempted to unite all the forces of the universe in a single theory. When he died, he was still doing what he loved. If he hadn’t been a physicist, he said, he would have been happy as a musician. When he wasn’t focused on physics or mathematics, he enjoyed playing the violin. Reaching a state of flow while working on his formulas or playing music, his two <em>ikigais</em>, brought him endless pleasure.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_80\" title=\"80\"/>Many such artists might seem misanthropic or reclusive, but what they are really doing is protecting the time that brings them happiness, sometimes at the expense of other aspects of their lives. They are outliers who apply the principles of flow to their lives to an extreme.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Another example of this kind of artist is the novelist Haruki Murakami. He sees only a close circle of friends, and appears in public in Japan only once every few years.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Artists know how important it is to protect their space, control their environment, and be free of distractions if they want to flow with their <em>ikigai</em>.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-58\">Microflow: Enjoying mundane tasks</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">But what happens when we have to, say, do the laundry, mow the lawn, or attend to paperwork? Is there a way to make these mundane tasks enjoyable?</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Near the Shinjuku subway station, in one of the neural centers of Tokyo, there is a supermarket that still employs elevator operators. The elevators are fairly standard and could easily be operated by the customers, but the store prefers to provide the service of someone holding the door open for you, pushing the button for your floor, and bowing as you exit.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">If you ask around, you’ll learn that there is one elevator operator who has been doing the same job since 2004. She is <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_81\" title=\"81\"/>always smiling and enthusiastic about her work. How is she able to enjoy such a job? Doesn’t she get bored doing something so repetitive?</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">On closer inspection, it becomes clear that the elevator operator is not just pushing buttons but is instead performing a whole sequence of movements. She begins by greeting the customers with a songlike salutation followed by a bow and a welcoming wave of the hand. Then she presses the elevator button with a graceful movement, as though she is a geisha offering a client a cup of tea.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Csikszentmihalyi calls this <em>microflow</em>.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">We’ve all been bored in a class or at a conference and started doodling to keep ourselves entertained. Or whistled while painting a wall. If we’re not truly being challenged, we get bored and add a layer of complexity to amuse ourselves. Our ability to turn routine tasks into moments of microflow, into something we enjoy, is key to our being happy, since we all have to do such tasks.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Even Bill Gates washes the dishes every night. He says he enjoys it—that it helps him relax and clear his mind, and that he tries to do it a little better each day, following an established order or set of rules he’s made for himself: plates first, forks second, and so on.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">It’s one of his daily moments of microflow.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Richard Feynman, one of the most important physicists of all <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_82\" title=\"82\"/>time, also took pleasure in routine tasks. W. Daniel Hillis, one of the founders of the supercomputer manufacturer Thinking Machines, hired Feynman to work on the development of a computer that could handle parallel processing when he was already world famous. He says Feynman showed up on his first day of work and said, “OK, boss, what’s my assignment?” They didn’t have anything prepared, so they asked him to work on a certain mathematical problem. He immediately realized they were giving him an irrelevant task to keep him busy and said, “That sounds like a bunch of baloney—give me something real to do.”</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">So they sent him to a nearby shop to buy office supplies, and he completed his assignment with a smile on his face. When he didn’t have something important to do or needed to rest his mind, Feynman dedicated himself to microflowing—say, painting the office walls.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Weeks later, after visiting the Thinking Machines offices a group of investors declared, “You have a Nobel laureate in there painting walls and soldering circuits.”<a href=\"9781524704551_EPUB-24.xhtml#EndnoteNumber17\" id=\"SuperscriptNumber17\"><sup class=\"endnote\">8</sup></a></p>&#13;\n",

      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">If we want to get better at reaching a state of flow, meditation is an excellent antidote to our smartphones and their notifications constantly clamoring for our attention.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">One of the most common mistakes among people starting to meditate is worrying about doing it “right,” achieving absolute mental silence, or reaching “nirvana.” The most important thing is to focus on the journey.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Since the mind is a constant swirl of thoughts, ideas, and emotions, slowing down the “centrifuge”—even for just a few <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_84\" title=\"84\"/>seconds—can help us feel more rested and leave us with a sense of clarity.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">In fact, one of the things we learn in the practice of meditation is not to worry about anything that flits across our mental screen. The idea of killing our boss might flash into our mind, but we simply label it as a thought and let it pass like a cloud, without judging or rejecting it. It is only a thought—one of the sixty thousand we have every day, according to some experts.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Meditation generates alpha and theta brain waves. For those experienced in meditation, these waves appear right away, while it might take a half hour for a beginner to experience them. These relaxing brain waves are the ones that are activated right before we fall asleep, as we lie in the sun, or right after taking a hot bath.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">We all carry a spa with us everywhere we go. It’s just a matter of knowing how to get in—something anyone can do, with a bit of practice.</p>&#13;\n",

      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">Life is inherently ritualistic. We could argue that humans naturally follow rituals that keep us busy. In some modern cultures, we have been forced out of our ritualistic lives to pursue goal after goal in order to be seen as successful. But <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_85\" title=\"85\"/>throughout history, humans have always been busy. We were hunting, cooking, farming, exploring, and raising families—activities that were structured as rituals to keep us busy throughout our days.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">But in an unusual way, rituals still permeate daily life and business practices in modern Japan. The main religions in Japan—Confucianism, Buddhism, and Shintoism—are all ones in which the rituals are more important than absolute rules.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">When doing business in Japan, process, manners, and how you work on something is more important than the final results. Whether this is good or bad for the economy is beyond the scope of this book. What is indisputable, though, is that finding flow in a “ritualistic workplace” is much easier than in one in which we are continually stressed out trying to achieve unclear goals set by our bosses.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Rituals give us clear rules and objectives, which help us enter a state of flow. When we have only a big goal in front of us, we might feel lost or overwhelmed by it; rituals help us by giving us the process, the <em>substeps</em>, on the path to achieving a goal. When confronted with a big goal, try to break it down into parts and then attack each part one by one.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Focus on enjoying your daily rituals, using them as tools to enter a state of flow. Don’t worry about the outcome—it will come naturally. Happiness is in the doing, not in the result. As a rule of thumb, remind yourself: “Rituals over goals.”</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_86\" title=\"86\"/>The happiest people are not the ones who achieve the most. They are the ones who spend more time than others in a state of flow.</p>&#13;\n",

      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">After reading this chapter you should have a better idea of which activities in your life make you enter flow. Write all of them on a piece of paper, then ask yourself these questions: What do the activities that drive you to flow have in common? Why do those activities drive you to flow? For example, are all the activities you most like doing ones that you practice alone or with other people? Do you flow more when doing things that require you to move your body or just to think?</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">In the answers to these questions you might find the underlying <em>ikigai</em> that drives your life. If you don’t, then keep searching by going deeper into what you like by spending more of your time in the activities that make you flow. Also, try new things that are not on the list of what makes you flow but that are similar and that you are curious about. For example, if photography is something that drives you into flow, you could also try painting; you might even like it more! Or if you love snowboarding and have never tried surfing . . .</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Flow is mysterious. It is like a muscle: the more you train it, the more you will flow, and the closer you will be to your <em>ikigai</em>.</p>&#13;\n",

Today there are an estimated 300 to 450 supercentenarians in the world, although the age of only around 75 of them has been confirmed.

Several months earlier we had contacted the town council of a place known as the Village of Longevity to explain the purpose of our trip and our intention to interview the oldest members of the community. After numerous conversations, we finally got the help we were looking for and were able to rent a house just outside the town.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">One year after starting this project, we found ourselves on the doorstep of some of the longest-living people in the world.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">We realized right away that time seems to have stopped there, as though the entire town were living in an endless here and now.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-74\">Arriving in Ogimi</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">After two hours on the road from Naha, we’re finally able to stop worrying about the traffic. To our left are the sea and an empty stretch of beach; to our right, the mountainous jungle of Okinawa’s Yanbaru forests.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Once Route 58 passes Nago, where Orion beer—the pride of Okinawa—is made, it skirts the coast until it reaches Ogimi. Every now and then a few little houses and stores crop up in the narrow stretch of land between the road and the base of the mountain.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">We pass small clusters of houses scattered here and there <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_104\" title=\"104\"/>as we enter the municipality of Ogimi, but the town doesn’t really seem to have a center. Our GPS finally guides us to our destination: the Center for the Support and Promotion of Well-Being, housed in an unattractive cinderblock building right off the highway.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">We go in through the back door, where a man named Taira is waiting for us. Beside him is a petite, cheerful woman who introduces herself as Yuki. Two other women immediately get up from desks and show us to a conference room. They serve us each a cup of green tea and a few <em>shikuwasa</em>, a small citrus fruit that packs a big nutritional punch, as we will see later on.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Taira sits down across from us in his formal suit and opens up a large planner and a three-ring binder. Yuki sits next to him. The binder contains a list of all the town’s residents, organized by age and “club,” or <em>moai</em>. Taira points out that these groups of people who help one another are characteristic of Ogimi. The <em>moai</em> are not organized around any concrete objective; they function more like a family. Taira also tells us that volunteer work, rather than money, drives much of what happens in Ogimi. Everyone offers to pitch in, and the local government takes care of assigning tasks. This way, everyone can be useful and feels like a part of the community.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Ogimi is the penultimate town before Cape Hedo, the northernmost point of the largest island in the archipelago.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">From the top of one of Ogimi’s mountains, we’re able to <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_105\" title=\"105\"/>look down over the whole town. Almost everything is the green of the Yanbaru jungle, making us wonder where the nearly thirty-two hundred residents are hiding. We can see a few houses, but they’re scattered in little clusters near the sea or in small valleys accessible by side roads.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-75\">Communal life</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">We’re invited to eat in one of Ogimi’s few restaurants, but when we arrive the only three tables are already reserved.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">“Don’t worry, we’ll go to Churaumi instead. It never fills up,” says Yuki, walking back to her car.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">She’s still driving at age eighty-eight, and takes great pride in that. Her copilot is ninety-nine, and has also decided to spend the day with us. We have to drive fast to keep up with them on a highway that is sometimes more dirt than asphalt. Finally reaching the other end of the jungle, we can at last sit down to eat.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">“I don’t really go to restaurants,” Yuki says as we take our seats. “Almost everything I eat comes from my vegetable garden, and I buy my fish from Tanaka, who’s been my friend forever.”</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The restaurant is right by the sea and seems like something from the planet Tatooine, from <em>Star Wars</em>. The menu boasts in large letters that it serves “slow food” prepared with organic vegetables grown in the town.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_106\" title=\"106\"/>“But really,” Yuki continues, “food is the least important thing.” She is extroverted, and rather pretty. She likes to talk about her role as the director of several associations run by the local government.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">“Food won’t help you live longer,” she says, bringing to her lips a bite of the diminutive confection that followed our meal. “The secret is smiling and having a good time.”</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">There are no bars and only a few restaurants in Ogimi, but those who live there enjoy a rich social life that revolves around community centers. The town is divided into seventeen neighborhoods, and each one has a president and several people in charge of things like culture, festivals, social activities, and longevity.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Residents pay close attention to this last category.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">We’re invited to the community center of one of the seventeen neighborhoods. It is an old building right next to one of the mountains of the Yanbaru jungle, home to bunagaya, the town’s iconic sprites.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<div class=\"Sidebar-Grey\"><h2 class=\"x10-Sidebar-Title\">The Bunagaya Spirits of the Yanbaru Jungle</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x10-Sidebar-Body-Text-First\">Bunagaya are magical creatures that inhabit the Yanbaru jungle near Ogimi and its surrounding towns. They manifest as children with long red hair, and like <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_107\" title=\"107\"/>to hide in the jungle’s gajumaru (banyan) trees and go fishing on the beach.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x10-Sidebar-Body-Text\">Many of Okinawa’s stories and fables are about bunagaya sprites. They are mischievous, playful, and unpredictable. Locals say that the bunagaya love the mountains, rivers, sea, trees, earth, wind, and animals, and that if you want to befriend them, you have to show respect for nature.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t</div>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-76\">A birthday party</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">When we arrive at the neighborhood’s community center, we’re greeted by a group of about twenty people who proudly proclaim, “The youngest among us is eighty-three!”</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">We conduct our interviews at a large table while drinking green tea. When we finish, we’re brought to an event space, where we celebrate the birthdays of three members of the group. One woman is turning ninety-nine, another ninety-four, and one “young man” has just reached eighty-nine.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">We sing a few songs popular in the village and finish up with “Happy Birthday” in English. The woman turning ninety-nine blows out the candles and thanks everyone for coming to her party. We eat homemade <em>shikuwasa</em> cake and <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_108\" title=\"108\"/>end up dancing and celebrating as though it were the birthday of a twentysomething.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">It’s the first party, but not the last, that we’ll attend during our week in the village. We’ll also do karaoke with a group of seniors who sing better than we do, and attend a traditional festival with local bands, dancers, and food stands at the foot of a mountain.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-77\">Celebrate each day, together</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">Celebrations seem to be an essential part of life in Ogimi.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">We’re invited to watch a game of gateball, one of the most popular sports among Okinawa’s older residents. It involves hitting a ball with a mallet-like stick. It is a low-impact sport that can be played anywhere, and is a good excuse to move around and have fun as a group. The residents hold local competitions, and there is no age limit for participants.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">We participate in the weekly game and lose to a woman who recently turned 104. Everyone cheers, and the defeated look on our faces elicits laughter.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">In addition to playing and celebrating as a community, spirituality is also essential to the happiness of the village’s residents.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-78\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_109\" title=\"109\"/>The gods of Okinawa</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">The main religion in Okinawa is known as Ryukyu Shinto. <em>Ryukyu</em> is the original name of the Okinawa archipelago, and <em>Shinto</em> means “the path of the gods.”<a href=\"9781524704551_EPUB-24.xhtml#EndnoteNumber33\" id=\"SuperscriptNumber33\"><sup class=\"endnote\">1</sup></a> Ryukyu Shinto combines elements of Chinese Taoism, Confucianism, Buddhism, and Shintoism with shamanistic and animistic elements.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">According to this ancient faith, the world is populated by an infinite number of spirits divided into several types: spirits of the home, of the forest, of the trees, and of the mountains. It is important to appease these spirits through rituals and festivals, and by consecrating sacred grounds.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Okinawa is full of sacred jungles and forests, where many of the two main kinds of temples are found: the <em>utaki</em> and the <em>uganju</em>. We visited an <em>uganju</em>, or small, open-air temple adorned with incense and coins, next to a waterfall in Ogimi. The <em>utaki</em> is a collection of stones where people go to pray and where, supposedly, spirits gather.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">In Okinawa’s religious practice, women are considered spiritually superior to men, whereas the opposite is true of traditional Shintoism in the rest of Japan. <em>Yuta</em> are women chosen as mediums by their communities to make contact with the spirit realm through traditional rites.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Ancestor worship is another important feature of spiritual <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_110\" title=\"110\"/>practice in Okinawa, and in Japan in general. The home of each generation’s firstborn usually contains a <em>butsudan</em>, or small altar, used to pray for and make offerings to the family’s ancestors.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<div class=\"Sidebar-Grey\"><h2 class=\"x10-Sidebar-Title\"><span class=\"BOLD_ITAL\">Mabui</span></h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x10-Sidebar-Body-Text-First\">Every person has an essence, or <em>mabui</em>. This<em> mabui</em> is our spirit and the source of our life force. It is immortal and makes us who we are.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x10-Sidebar-Body-Text\">Sometimes, the <em>mabui</em> of someone who has died is trapped in the body of a living person. This situation requires a separation ritual to free the <em>mabui</em> of the deceased; it often happens when a person dies suddenly—especially at a young age—and his or her <em>mabui</em> does not want to move on to the realm of the dead.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x10-Sidebar-Body-Text\">A <em>mabui</em> can also be passed from person to person by physical contact. A grandmother who leaves her granddaughter a ring transfers a part of her <em>mabui</em> to her. Photographs can also be a medium for passing <em>mabui</em> among people.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t</div>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-79\">The older, the stronger</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">Looking back, our days in Ogimi were intense but relaxed—sort of like the lifestyle of the locals, who always seemed to be busy with important tasks but who, upon closer inspection, <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_111\" title=\"111\"/>did everything with a sense of calm. They were always pursuing their <em>ikigai</em>, but they were never in a rush.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Not only did they seem to be happily busy, but we also noticed that they followed the other principles for happiness that Washington Burnap stated two hundred years ago: “The grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do, something to love, and something to hope for.”<a href=\"9781524704551_EPUB-24.xhtml#EndnoteNumber34\" id=\"SuperscriptNumber34\"><sup class=\"endnote\">2</sup></a></p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">On our last day, we went to buy gifts at a small market at the edge of town. The only things sold there are local vegetables, green tea, and <em>shikuwasa</em> juice, along with bottles of water from a spring hidden in the Yanbaru forests, bearing labels that read “Longevity Water.”</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">We bought ourselves some of this Longevity Water and drank it in the parking lot, looking out over the sea and hoping that the little bottles that promised a magic elixir would bring us health and long life, and would help us find our own <em>ikigai</em>. Then we took a photo with a statue of a bunagaya, and walked up to it one last time to read the inscription:</p>&#13;\n",

We filmed these conversations with two cameras for use in a little documentary, and chose a few especially meaningful and inspiring statements to include in this section of the book.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h3 class=\"x05-Head-B\">1. Don’t worry</h3>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x06-Extract-1P-First\">“The secret to a long life is not to worry. And to keep your heart young—don’t let it grow old. Open your heart to people with a nice smile on your face. If you smile and open your heart, your grandchildren and everyone else will want to see you.”</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x06-Extract-1P\">“The best way to avoid anxiety is to go out in the street and say hello to people. I do it every day. I go out there and say, ‘Hello!’ <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_113\" title=\"113\"/>and ‘See you later!’ Then I go home and care for my vegetable garden. In the afternoon, I spend time with friends.”</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x06-Extract-1P\">“Here, everyone gets along. We try not to cause problems. Spending time together and having fun is the only thing that matters.”</p>&#13;\n",

      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x06-Extract-1P-First\">“I feel joy every morning waking up at six and opening the curtains to look out at my garden, where I grow my own vegetables. I go right outside to check on my tomatoes, my mandarin oranges . . . I love the sight of them—it relaxes me. After an hour in the garden I go back inside and make breakfast.”</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x06-Extract-1P\">“I plant my own vegetables and cook them myself. That’s my <em>ikigai</em>.”</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x06-Extract-1P\">“The key to staying sharp in old age is in your fingers. From your fingers to your brain, and back again. If you keep your fingers busy, you’ll live to see one hundred.”</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x06-Extract-1P\">“I get up at four every day. I set my alarm for that time, have a cup of coffee, and do a little exercise, lifting my arms. That gives me energy for the rest of the day.”</p>&#13;\n",

      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The most concrete and widely cited data on diet in <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_123\" title=\"123\"/>Okinawa come from studies by Makoto Suzuki, a cardiologist at the University of the Ryukyus, who has published more than seven hundred scientific articles on nutrition and aging in Okinawa since 1970.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Bradley J. Willcox and D. Craig Willcox joined Makoto Suzuki’s research team and published a book considered the bible on the subject, <em>The Okinawa Program</em>.<a href=\"9781524704551_EPUB-24.xhtml#EndnoteNumber35\" id=\"SuperscriptNumber35\"><sup class=\"endnote\">1</sup></a> They reached the following conclusions:</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<ul>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted-First\">Locals eat a<em> wide variety of foods</em>, especially vegetables. Variety seems to be key. A study of Okinawa’s centenarians showed that they ate 206 different foods, including spices, on a regular basis. They ate an average of eighteen different foods each day, a striking contrast to the nutritional poverty of our fast-food culture.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted\"><em>They eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day</em>. At least seven types of fruits and vegetables are consumed by Okinawans on a daily basis. The easiest way to check if there is enough variety on your table is to make sure you’re “eating the rainbow.” A table featuring red peppers, carrots, spinach, cauliflower, and eggplant, for example, offers great color and variety. Vegetables, potatoes, legumes, and soy products such as tofu are the staples of an Okinawan’s diet. More than 30 percent of their daily calories comes from vegetables.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted\"><em><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_124\" title=\"124\"/>Grains are the foundation of their diet</em>. Japanese people eat white rice every day, sometimes adding noodles. Rice is the primary food in Okinawa, as well.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted-Last\"><em>They rarely eat sugar</em>, and if they do, it’s cane sugar. We drove through several sugarcane fields every morning on our way to Ogimi, and even drank a glass of cane juice at Nakijin Castle. Beside the stall selling the juice was a sign describing the anticarcinogenic benefits of sugarcane.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t</ul>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">In addition to these basic dietary principles, Okinawans eat fish an average of three times per week; unlike in other parts of Japan, the most frequently consumed meat is pork, though locals eat it only once or twice per week.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Along these lines, Makoto Suzuki’s studies indicate the following:</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<ul>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted-First\">Okinawans consume, in general, one-third as much sugar as the rest of Japan’s population, which means that sweets and chocolate are much less a part of their diet.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted\">They also eat practically half as much salt as the rest of Japan: 7 grams per day, compared to an average of 12.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted-Last\">They consume fewer calories: an average of 1,785 per day, compared to 2,068 in the rest of Japan. In fact, low caloric intake is common among the five Blue Zones.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t</ul>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-85\"><em><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_125\" title=\"125\"/>Hara hachi bu</em></h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">This brings us back to the 80 percent rule we mentioned in the first chapter, a concept known in Japanese as <em>hara hachi bu</em>. It’s easy to do: When you notice you’re almost full but <em>could</em> have a little more . . . just stop eating!</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">One easy way to start applying the concept of <em>hara hachi bu</em> is to skip dessert. Or to reduce portion size. The idea is to still be a <em>little bit</em> hungry when you finish.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">This is why portion size tends to be much smaller in Japan than in the West. Food isn’t served as appetizers, main courses, and dessert. Instead, it’s much more common to see everything presented at once on small plates: one with rice, another with vegetables, a bowl of miso soup, and something to snack on. Serving food on many small plates makes it easier to avoid eating too much, and facilitates the varied diet discussed at the beginning of this chapter.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><em>Hara hachi bu</em> is an ancient practice. The twelfth-century book on Zen Buddhism <em>Zazen Youjinki</em> recommends eating two-thirds as much as you might want to. Eating less than one might want is common among all Buddhist temples in the East. Perhaps Buddhism recognized the benefits of limiting caloric intake more than nine centuries ago.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-86\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_126\" title=\"126\"/>So, eat less to live longer?</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">Few would challenge this idea. Without taking it to the extreme of malnutrition, of course, eating fewer calories than our bodies ask for seems to increase longevity. The key to staying healthy while consuming fewer calories is eating foods with a high nutritional value (especially “superfoods”) and avoiding those that add to our overall caloric intake but offer little to no nutritional value.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The calorie restriction we’ve been discussing is one of the most effective ways to add years to your life. If the body regularly consumes enough, or too many, calories, it gets lethargic and starts to wear down, expending significant energy on digestion alone.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Another benefit of calorie restriction is that it reduces levels of IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) in the body. IGF-1 is a protein that plays a significant role in the aging process; it seems that one of the reasons humans and animals age is an excess of this protein in their blood.<a href=\"9781524704551_EPUB-24.xhtml#EndnoteNumber36\" id=\"SuperscriptNumber36\"><sup class=\"endnote\">2</sup></a></p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Whether calorie restriction will extend lifespan in humans is not yet known, but data increasingly indicate that moderate calorie restriction with adequate nutrition has a powerful protective effect against obesity, type 2 diabetes, inflammation, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease and reduces metabolic risk factors associated with cancer.<a href=\"9781524704551_EPUB-24.xhtml#EndnoteNumber37\" id=\"SuperscriptNumber37\"><sup class=\"endnote\">3</sup></a></p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_127\" title=\"127\"/>An alternative to following the 80 percent rule on a daily basis is to fast for one or two days each week. The 5:2 (or fasting) diet recommends two days of fasting (consuming fewer than five hundred calories) every week and eating normally on the other five days.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Among its many benefits, fasting helps cleanse the digestive system and allows it to rest.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-87\">15 natural antioxidants found in the Okinawan diet</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">Antioxidants are molecules that slow the oxidation process in cells, neutralizing the free radicals that cause damage and accelerate aging.

      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">Okinawans drink more Sanpin-cha—a mix of green tea and jasmine flowers—than any other kind of tea. The closest approximation in the West would be the jasmine tea that usually comes from China.

      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">This morning warm-up has been around since before World War II. The “radio” part of its name is from when the instructions for each exercise were transmitted over the radio, but today people usually do these movements while tuned to a television channel or Internet video demonstrating the steps.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">One of the main purposes of doing radio taiso is to promote a spirit of unity among participants. The exercises are always done in groups, usually in schools before the start of classes, and in businesses before the workday begins.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Statistics show that 30 percent of Japanese practice radio taiso for a few minutes every morning, but radio taiso is one <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_138\" title=\"138\"/>thing that almost everyone we interviewed in Ogimi had in common. Even the residents of the nursing home we visited dedicated at least five minutes every day to it, though some did the exercises from their wheelchairs. We joined them on their daily practice and we felt refreshed for the rest of the day.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">When these exercises are done in a group, it is usually on a sports field or in a large reception hall, and typically involves some kind of loudspeaker.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The exercises take five or ten minutes, depending on whether you do all or only some of them. They focus on dynamic stretching and increasing joint mobility. One of the most iconic radio taiso exercises consists of simply raising your arms above your head and then bringing them down in a circular motion. It is a tool to wake up the body, an easy mobility workout that is low in intensity and that focuses on exercising as many joints as possible.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">It might seem basic, but in our modern lives, we can spend days without raising our arms above our ears. Think about it: our arms are down when using computers, when using smartphones, when reading books. One of the few times we raise our hands over our heads is when reaching for something in a cupboard or closet, while our ancestors were raising their hands over their heads all the time when gathering things from trees. Radio taiso helps us to practice all the basic movements of the body.</p>&#13;\n",

      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Sooner or later, we all have to face difficult moments, and the way we do this can make a huge difference to our quality of life. Proper training for our mind, body, and emotional resilience is essential for confronting life’s ups and downs.</p>&#13;\n",

      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Resilient people know how to stay focused on their objectives, on what matters, without giving in to discouragement. Their flexibility is the source of their strength: They know how to adapt to change and to reversals of fortune. They concentrate on the things they can control and don’t worry about those they can’t.</p>&#13;\n",

      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-105\">Emotional resilience through Buddhism and Stoicism</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">Siddhārtha Gautama (Buddha) was born a prince of Kapilavastu, Nepal, and grew up in a palace, surrounded by riches. At sixteen he married and had a child.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_167\" title=\"167\"/>Not satisfied by his family’s wealth, at twenty-nine he decided to try a different lifestyle and ran away from the palace to live as an ascetic. But it wasn’t asceticism that he was looking for; it didn’t offer the happiness and well-being he sought. Neither wealth nor extreme asceticism worked for him. He realized that a wise person should not ignore life’s pleasures. A wise person can live with these pleasures but should always remain conscious of how easy it is to be enslaved by them.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Zeno of Citium began his studies with the Cynics. The Cynics also led ascetic lives, leaving behind all earthly pleasures. They lived in the street, and the only thing they owned was the clothing on their backs.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Seeing that Cynicism did not give him a sense of well-being, Zeno abandoned its teachings to found the school of Stoicism, which centers on the idea that there is nothing wrong with enjoying life’s pleasures as long as they do not take control of your life as you enjoy them. You have to be prepared for those pleasures to disappear.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The goal is not to eliminate all feelings and pleasures from our lives, as in Cynicism, but to eliminate negative emotions.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Since their inception, one of the objectives of both Buddhism and Stoicism has been to control pleasure, emotions, and desires. Though the philosophies are very different, both aim to curb our ego and control our negative emotions.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_168\" title=\"168\"/>Both Stoicism and Buddhism are, at their roots, methods for practicing well-being.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">According to Stoicism, our pleasures and desires are not the problem. We can enjoy them as long as they don’t take control of us. The Stoics viewed those who were able to control their emotions as virtuous.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-106\">What’s the worst thing that could happen?</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">We finally land our dream job, but after a little while we are already hunting for a better one. We win the lottery and buy a nice car but then decide we can’t live without a sailboat. We finally win the heart of the man or woman we’ve been pining for and suddenly find we have a wandering eye.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">People can be insatiable.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The Stoics believed that these kinds of desires and ambitions are not worth pursuing. The objective of the virtuous person is to reach a state of tranquility (<em>apatheia</em>): the absence of negative feelings such as anxiety, fear, shame, vanity, and anger, and the presence of positive feelings such as happiness, love, serenity, and gratitude.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">In order to keep their minds virtuous, the Stoics practiced something like negative visualization: They imagined the worst thing that could happen in order to be prepared if certain privileges and pleasures were taken from them.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_169\" title=\"169\"/>To practice negative visualization, we have to reflect on negative events, but without worrying about them.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Seneca, one of the richest men in ancient Rome, lived a life of luxury but was, nonetheless, an active Stoic. He recommended practicing negative visualization every night before falling asleep. In fact, he not only imagined these negative situations, he actually put them into practice—for example, by living for a week without servants, or the food and drink he was used to as a wealthy man. As a result, he was able to answer the question “What’s the worst thing that could happen?”</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-107\">Meditating for healthier emotions</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">In addition to negative visualization and not giving in to negative emotions, another central tenet of Stoicism is <em>knowing what we can control and what we can’t</em>, as we see in the Serenity Prayer.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Worrying about things that are beyond our control accomplishes nothing. We should have a clear sense of what we can change and what we can’t, which in turn will allow us to resist giving in to negative emotions.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">In the words of Epictetus, “It’s not what happens to you, but how you react that matters.”<a href=\"9781524704551_EPUB-24.xhtml#EndnoteNumber44\" id=\"SuperscriptNumber44\"><sup class=\"endnote\">1</sup></a></p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">In Zen Buddhism, meditation is a way to become aware of <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_170\" title=\"170\"/>our desires and emotions and thereby free ourselves from them. It is not simply a question of keeping the mind free of thoughts but instead involves observing our thoughts and emotions as they appear, without getting carried away by them. In this way, we train our minds not to get swept up in anger, jealousy, or resentment.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">One of the most commonly used mantras in Buddhism focuses on controlling negative emotions: “Oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ ,” in which <em>oṃ</em> is the generosity that purifies the ego, <em>ma</em> is the ethics that purifies jealousy, <em>ṇi</em> is the patience that purifies passion and desire, <em>pad</em> is the precision that purifies bias, <em>me</em> is the surrender that purifies greed, and <em>hūṃ</em> is the wisdom that purifies hatred.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-108\">The here and now, and the impermanence of things</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">Another key to cultivating resilience is knowing in which time to live. Both Buddhism and Stoicism remind us that the present is all that exists, and it is the only thing we can control. Instead of worrying about the past or the future, we should appreciate things just as they are in the moment, in the now.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">“The only moment in which you can be truly alive is the <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_171\" title=\"171\"/>present moment,” observes the Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">In addition to living in the here and now, the Stoics recommend reflecting on the impermanence of the things around us.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius said that the things we love are like the leaves of a tree: They can fall at any moment with a gust of wind. He also said that changes in the world around us are not accidental but rather form part of the essence of the universe—a rather Buddhist notion, in fact.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">We should never forget that everything we have and all the people we love will disappear at some point. This is something we should keep in mind, but without giving in to pessimism. Being aware of the impermanence of things does not have to make us sad; it should help us love the present moment and those who surround us.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">“All things human are short-lived and perishable,” Seneca tells us.<a href=\"9781524704551_EPUB-24.xhtml#EndnoteNumber45\" id=\"SuperscriptNumber45\"><sup class=\"endnote\">2</sup></a></p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The temporary, ephemeral, and impermanent nature of the world is central to every Buddhist discipline. Keeping this always in mind helps us avoid excessive pain in times of loss.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-109\"><em><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_172\" title=\"172\"/>Wabi-sabi</em> and <em>ichi-go ichi-e</em></h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\"><em>Wabi-sabi</em> is a Japanese concept that shows us the beauty of the fleeting, changeable, and imperfect nature of the world around us. Instead of searching for beauty in perfection, we should look for it in things that are flawed, incomplete.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">This is why the Japanese place such value, for example, on an irregular or cracked teacup. Only things that are imperfect, incomplete, and ephemeral can truly be beautiful, because only those things resemble the natural world.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">A complementary Japanese concept is that of <em>ichi-go ichi-e</em>, which could be translated as “This moment exists only now and won’t come again.” It is heard most often in social gatherings as a reminder that each encounter—whether with friends, family, or strangers—is unique and will never be repeated, meaning that we should enjoy the moment and not lose ourselves in worries about the past or the future.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The concept is commonly used in tea ceremonies, Zen meditation, and Japanese martial arts, all of which place emphasis on being present in the moment.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">In the West, we’ve grown accustomed to the permanence of the stone buildings and cathedrals of Europe, which sometimes gives us the sense that nothing changes, making us forget about the passage of time. Greco-Roman architecture <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_173\" title=\"173\"/>adores symmetry, sharp lines, imposing facades, and buildings and statues of the gods that outlast the centuries.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Japanese architecture, on the other hand, doesn’t try to be imposing or perfect, because it is built in the spirit of <em>wabi-sabi</em>. The tradition of making structures out of wood presupposes their impermanence and the need for future generations to rebuild them. Japanese culture accepts the fleeting nature of the human being and everything we create.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The Grand Shrine of Ise,<a href=\"9781524704551_EPUB-24.xhtml#EndnoteNumber46\" id=\"SuperscriptNumber46\"><sup class=\"endnote\">3</sup></a> for example, has been rebuilt every twenty years for centuries. The most important thing is not to keep the <em>building</em> standing for generations, but to preserve customs and traditions—things that can withstand the passage of time better than structures made by human hands.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The key is to accept that there are certain things over which we have no control, like the passage of time and the ephemeral nature of the world around us.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><em>Ichi-go ichi-e</em> teaches us to focus on the present and enjoy each moment that life brings us. This is why it is so important to find and pursue our <em>ikigai</em>.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><em>Wabi-sabi</em> teaches us to appreciate the beauty of imperfection as an opportunity for growth.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-110\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_174\" title=\"174\"/>Beyond resilience: Antifragility</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">As the legend goes, the first time Hercules faced the Hydra, he despaired when he discovered that cutting off one of its heads meant that two would grow back in its place. He would never be able to kill the beast if it got stronger with every wound.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">As Nassim Nicholas Taleb explains in <em>Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder</em>,<a href=\"9781524704551_EPUB-24.xhtml#EndnoteNumber47\" id=\"SuperscriptNumber47\"><sup class=\"endnote\">4</sup></a> we use the word <em>fragile</em> to describe people, things, and organizations that are weakened when harmed, and the words <em>robust</em> and <em>resilient</em> for things that are able to withstand harm without weakening, but we don’t have a word for things that <em>get stronger when harmed </em>(up to a point)<em>.</em></p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">To refer to the kind of power possessed by the Hydra of Lerna, to talk about things that get stronger when they are harmed, Taleb proposes the term <em>antifragile:</em> “Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.”</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Catastrophes and exceptional circumstances offer good models for explaining antifragility. In 2011 a tsunami hit the Tōhoku region of Japan, doing tremendous damage to dozens of cities and towns along the coast, most famously Fukushima.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">When we visited the affected coast two years after the <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_175\" title=\"175\"/>catastrophe, having driven for hours along cracked highways and past one empty gas station after another, we passed through several ghost towns whose streets had been taken over by the remnants of houses, piles of cars, and empty train stations. These towns were <em>fragile</em> spaces that had been forgotten by the government and could not recover on their own.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Other places, such as Ishinomaki and Kesennuma, suffered extensive damage but were rebuilt within a few years, thanks to the efforts of many. Ishinomaki and Kesennuma showed how <em>resilient</em> they were in their ability to return to normal after the catastrophe.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The earthquake that caused the tsunami also affected the Fukushima nuclear power plant. The Tokyo Electric Power Company engineers working at the plant were not prepared to recover from that kind of damage. The Fukushima nuclear facility is still in a state of emergency and will be for decades to come. It demonstrated its <em>fragility</em> in the face of an unprecedented catastrophe.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The Japanese financial markets closed minutes after the earthquake. Which businesses did the best in the aftermath? Stock in big construction companies has been steadily on the rise since 2011; the need to rebuild the entire coast of Tōhoku is a boon for construction. In this case, Japanese construction companies are <em>antifragile</em>, since they benefited enormously from the catastrophe.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_176\" title=\"176\"/>Now let’s take a look at how we can apply this concept to our daily lives. How can we be more antifragile?</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h3 class=\"x05-Head-B\">Step 1: Create redundancies</h3>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">Instead of having a single salary, try to find a way to make money from your hobbies, at other jobs, or by starting your own business. If you have only one salary, you might be left with nothing should your employer run into trouble, leaving you in a position of <em>fragility</em>. On the other hand, if you have several options and you lose your primary job, it might just happen that you end up dedicating more time to your secondary job, and maybe even make more money at it. You would have beaten that stroke of bad luck and would be, in that case, <em>antifragile</em>.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">One hundred percent of the seniors we interviewed in Ogimi had a primary and a secondary occupation. Most of them kept a vegetable garden as a secondary job, and sold their produce at the local market.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The same idea goes for friendships and personal interests. It’s just a matter, as the saying goes, of not putting all your eggs in one basket.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">In the sphere of romantic relationships, there are those who focus all their energy on their partner and make him or her their whole world. Those people lose everything if the relationship doesn’t work out, whereas if they’ve cultivated strong <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_177\" title=\"177\"/>friendships and a full life along the way, they’ll be in a better position to move on at the end of a relationship. They’ll be antifragile.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Right now you might be thinking, “I don’t need more than one salary, and I’m happy with the friends I’ve always had. Why should I add anything new?” It might seem like a waste of time to add variation to our lives, because extraordinary things don’t ordinarily happen. We slip into a comfort zone. But the unexpected always happens, sooner or later.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h3 class=\"x05-Head-B\">Step 2: Bet conservatively in certain areas and take many small risks in others</h3>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">The world of finance turns out to be very useful in explaining this concept. If you have $10,000 saved up, you might put $9,000 of that into an index fund or fixed-term deposit, and invest the remaining $1,000 in ten start-ups with huge growth potential—say, $100 in each.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">One possible scenario is that three of the companies fail (you lose $300), the value of three other companies goes down (you lose another $100 or $200), the value of three goes up (you make $100 or $200), and the value of one of the start-ups increases twenty-fold (you make nearly $2,000, or maybe even more).</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">You still make money, even if three of the businesses go completely belly-up. You’ve benefited from the damage, just like the Hydra.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_178\" title=\"178\"/>The key to becoming antifragile is taking on small risks that might lead to great reward, without exposing ourselves to dangers that might sink us, such as investing $10,000 in a fund of questionable reputation that we saw advertised in the newspaper.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h3 class=\"x05-Head-B\">Step 3: Get rid of the things that make you fragile</h3>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">We’re taking the negative route for this exercise. Ask yourself: What makes me fragile? Certain people, things, and habits generate losses for us and make us vulnerable. Who and what are they?</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">When we make our New Year’s resolutions, we tend to emphasize adding new challenges to our lives. It’s great to have this kind of objective, but setting “good riddance” goals can have an even bigger impact. For example:</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<ul>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted-First\">Stop snacking between meals</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted\">Eat sweets only once a week</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted\">Gradually pay off all debt</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted\">Avoid spending time with toxic people</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted\">Avoid spending time doing things we don’t enjoy, simply because we feel obligated to do them</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted-Last\">Spend no more than twenty minutes on Facebook per day</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t</ul>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_179\" title=\"179\"/>To build resilience into our lives, we shouldn’t fear adversity, because each setback is an opportunity for growth. If we adopt an antifragile attitude, we’ll find a way to get stronger with every blow, refining our lifestyle and staying focused on our <em>ikigai</em>.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Taking a hit or two can be viewed as either a misfortune or an experience that we can apply to all areas of our lives, as we continually make corrections and set new and better goals. As Taleb writes in <em>Antifragile</em>, “We need randomness, mess, adventures, uncertainty, self-discovery, hear traumatic episodes, all these things that make life worth living.” We encourage those interested in the concept of antifragility to read Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s <em>Antifragile</em>.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Life is pure imperfection, as the philosophy of <em>wabi-sabi</em> teaches us, and the passage of time shows us that everything is fleeting, but if you have a clear sense of your <em>ikigai</em>, each moment will hold so many possibilities that it will seem almost like an <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_180\" title=\"180\"/>eternity.</p>&#13;\n",

      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Many of Aida’s haikus philosophize about the importance of the present moment, and the passage of time. The poem reproduced below could be translated as “In the here and now, the only thing in my life is your life.”</p>&#13;\n",

      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x06-Poetry-1-Line-Character\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_182\" title=\"182\"/><span class=\"Japanese\">いまここ</span></p>&#13;\n",

      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Once you discover your <em>ikigai</em>, pursuing it and nurturing it every day will bring meaning to your life. The moment your life has this purpose, you will achieve a happy state of flow in all you do, like the calligrapher at his canvas or the chef who, after half a century, still prepares sushi for his patrons with love.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-113\">Conclusion</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL-No-Space\">Our <em>ikigai</em> is different for all of us, but one thing we have in common is that we are all searching for meaning. When we spend our days feeling connected to what is meaningful to <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_183\" title=\"183\"/>us, we live more fully; when we lose the connection, we feel despair.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Modern life estranges us more and more from our true nature, making it very easy for us to lead lives lacking in meaning. Powerful forces and incentives (money, power, attention, success) distract us on a daily basis; don’t let them take over your life.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Our intuition and curiosity are very powerful internal compasses to help us connect with our <em>ikigai</em>. Follow those things you enjoy, and get away from or change those you dislike. Be led by your curiosity, and keep busy by doing things that fill you with meaning and happiness. It doesn’t need to be a big thing: we might find meaning in being good parents or in helping our neighbors.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">There is no perfect strategy to connecting with our <em>ikigai</em>. But what we learned from the Okinawans is that we should not worry too much about finding it.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Life is not a problem to be solved. Just remember to have something that keeps you busy doing what you love while being surrounded by the people who love you.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-114\">The ten rules of <em>ikigai</em></h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">We’ll conclude this journey with ten rules we’ve distilled from the wisdom of the long-living residents of Ogimi:</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<ol>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Numbered-Para-First\" value=\"1\"><span class=\"BOLD_ITAL\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_184\" title=\"184\"/></span><strong>Stay active; don’t retire.</strong> Those who give up the things they love doing and do well lose their purpose in life. That’s why it’s so important to keep doing things of value, making progress, bringing beauty or utility to others, helping out, and shaping the world around you, even after your “official” professional activity has ended.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Numbered-Para\"><strong>Take it slow.</strong> Being in a hurry is inversely proportional to quality of life. As the old saying goes, “Walk slowly and you’ll go far.” When we leave urgency behind, life and time take on new meaning.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Numbered-Para\"><strong>Don’t fill your stomach.</strong> Less is more when it comes to eating for long life, too. According to the 80 percent rule, in order to stay healthier longer, we should eat a little less than our hunger demands instead of stuffing ourselves.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Numbered-Para\"><strong>Surround yourself with good friends.</strong> Friends are the best medicine, there for confiding worries over a good chat, sharing stories that brighten your day, getting advice, having fun, dreaming . . . in other words, living.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Numbered-Para\"><strong>Get in shape for your next birthday.</strong> Water moves; it is at its best when it flows fresh and doesn’t stagnate. The body you move through life in needs a bit of daily maintenance to keep it running for a long time. Plus, exercise releases hormones that make us feel happy.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Numbered-Para\"><strong>Smile.</strong> A cheerful attitude is not only relaxing—it also helps make friends. It’s good to recognize the things that <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_185\" title=\"185\"/>aren’t so great, but we should never forget what a privilege it is to be in the here and now in a world so full of possibilities.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Numbered-Para\"><strong>Reconnect with nature.</strong> Though most people live in cities these days, human beings are made to be part of the natural world. We should return to it often to recharge our batteries.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Numbered-Para\"><strong>Give thanks.</strong> To your ancestors, to nature, which provides you with the air you breathe and the food you eat, to your friends and family, to everything that brightens your days and makes you feel lucky to be alive. Spend a moment every day giving thanks, and you’ll watch your stockpile of happiness grow.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Numbered-Para\"><strong>Live in the moment.</strong> Stop regretting the past and fearing the future. Today is all you have. Make the most of it. Make it worth remembering.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Numbered-Para-Last\"><strong>Follow your </strong><span class=\"BOLD_ITAL\">ikigai</span><strong>.</strong> There is a passion inside you, a unique talent that gives meaning to your days and drives you to share the best of yourself until the very end. If you don’t know what your <em>ikigai</em> is yet, as Viktor Frankl says, your mission is to discover it.<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The authors of this book wish you a long, happy, and purposeful life.</p><p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Thank you for joining us,</p><p class=\"x14-Signature\">H<span class=\"SCAP\">ÉCTOR </span>G<span class=\"SCAP\">ARCÍA AND </span>F<span class=\"SCAP\">RANCESC <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_186\" title=\"186\"/></span>M<span class=\"SCAP\">IRALLES</span></p></li>&#13;\n",

Other scientists are less optimistic, predicting that we’ll reach a limit, a maximum age we won’t be able to surpass, no matter how much technology we have. For example, some biologists assert that our cells stop regenerating after about 120 years.</p>&#13;\n",

      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">There is much wisdom in the classic saying “mens sana in corpore sano” (“a sound mind in a sound body”): It reminds us that both mind and body are important, and that the health of one is connected to that of the other. It has been shown that maintaining an active, adaptable mind is one of the key factors in staying young.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Having a youthful mind also drives you toward a healthy lifestyle that will slow the aging process.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Just as a lack of physical exercise has negative effects on our bodies and mood, a lack of mental exercise is bad for us because it causes our neurons and neural connections to deteriorate—and, as a result, reduces our ability to react to our surroundings.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">This is why it’s so important to give your brain a workout.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">One pioneer in advocating for mental exercise is the <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_21\" title=\"21\"/>Israeli neuroscientist Shlomo Breznitz, who argues that the brain needs a lot of stimulation in order to stay in shape. As he stated in an interview with Eduard Punset for the Spanish television program <em>Redes</em>:</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x06-Extract-1P\">There is a tension between what is good for someone and what they want to do. This is because people, especially older people, like to do things as they’ve always done them. The problem is that when the brain develops ingrained habits, it doesn’t need to think anymore. Things get done quickly and efficiently on automatic pilot, often in a very advantageous way. This creates a tendency to stick to routines, and the only way of breaking these is to confront the brain with new information.<a href=\"9781524704551_EPUB-24.xhtml#EndnoteNumber1\" id=\"SuperscriptNumber1\"><sup class=\"endnote\">1</sup></a></p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-Space\">Presented with new information, the brain creates new connections and is revitalized. This is why it is so important to expose yourself to change, even if stepping outside your comfort zone means feeling a bit of anxiety.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The effects of mental training have been scientifically demonstrated. According to Collins Hemingway and Shlomo Breznitz in their book <em>Maximum Brainpower: Challenging the Brain for Health and Wisdom</em>, mental training is beneficial on many levels: “You begin exercising your brain by doing a certain task for the first time,” he writes. “And at first it seems very difficult, but as you learn how to do it, the training is already working. The <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_22\" title=\"22\"/>second time, you realize that it’s easier, not harder, to do, because you’re getting better at it. This has a fantastic effect on a person’s mood. In and of itself, it is a transformation that affects not only the results obtained, but also his or her self-image.”</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">This description of a “mental workout” might sound a bit formal, but simply interacting with others—playing a game, for example—offers new stimuli and helps prevent the depression that can come with solitude.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Our neurons start to age while we are still in our twenties. This process is slowed, however, by intellectual activity, curiosity, and a desire to learn. Dealing with new situations, learning something new every day, playing games, and interacting with other people seem to be essential antiaging strategies for the mind. Furthermore, a more positive outlook in this regard will yield greater mental benefits.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-22\">Stress: Accused of killing longevity</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">Many people seem older than they are. Research into the causes of premature aging has shown that stress has a lot to do with it, because the body wears down much faster during periods of crisis. The American Institute of Stress investigated this degenerative process and concluded that <em>most health problems </em>are caused by stress.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_23\" title=\"23\"/>Researchers at the Heidelberg University Hospital conducted a study in which they subjected a young doctor to a job interview, which they made even more stressful by forcing him to solve complex math problems for thirty minutes. Afterward, they took a blood sample. What they discovered was that his antibodies had reacted to stress the same way they react to pathogens, activating the proteins that trigger an immune response. The problem is that this response not only neutralizes harmful agents, it also damages healthy cells, leading them to age prematurely.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The University of California conducted a similar study, taking data and samples from thirty-nine women who had high levels of stress due to the illness of one of their children and comparing them to samples from women with healthy children and low levels of stress. They found that stress promotes cellular aging by weakening cell structures known as telomeres, which affect cellular regeneration and how our cells age. As the study revealed, the greater the stress, the greater the degenerative effect on cells.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-23\">How does stress work?</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">These days, people live at a frantic pace and in a nearly constant state of competition. At this fever pitch, stress is a natural <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_24\" title=\"24\"/>response to the information being received by the body as potentially dangerous or problematic.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Theoretically, this is a useful reaction, as it helps us survive in hostile surroundings. Over the course of our evolution, we have used this response to deal with difficult situations and to flee from predators.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The alarm that goes off in our head makes our neurons activate the pituitary gland, which produces hormones that release corticotropin, which in turn circulates through the body via the sympathetic nervous system. The adrenal gland is then triggered to release adrenaline and cortisol. Adrenaline raises our respiratory rate and pulse and prepares our muscles for action, getting the body ready to react to perceived danger, while cortisol increases the release of dopamine and blood glucose, which is what gets us “charged up” and allows us to face challenges.</p>&#13;\n",

      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-Space\">These processes are, in moderation, beneficial—they help us overcome challenges in our daily lives. Nonetheless, the stress to which human beings are subjected today is clearly harmful.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Stress has a degenerative effect over time. A sustained state of emergency affects the neurons associated with memory, as well as inhibiting the release of certain hormones, the absence of which can cause depression. Its secondary effects include irritability, insomnia, anxiety, and high blood pressure.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">As such, though challenges are good for keeping mind and body active, we should adjust our high-stress lifestyles in order to avoid the premature aging of our bodies.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-24\">Be mindful about reducing stress</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">Whether or not the threats we perceive are real, stress is an easily identifiable condition that not only causes anxiety but is also highly psychosomatic, affecting everything from our digestive system to our skin.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_26\" title=\"26\"/>This is why prevention is so important in avoiding the toll that stress takes on us—and why many experts recommend practicing mindfulness.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">The central premise of this stress-reduction method is focusing on the self: noticing our responses, even if they are conditioned by habit, in order to be fully conscious of them. In this way, we connect with the here and now and limit thoughts that tend to spiral out of control.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">“We have to learn to turn off the autopilot that’s steering us in an endless loop. We all know people who snack while talking on the phone or watching the news. You ask them if the omelet they just ate had onion in it, and they can’t tell you,” says Roberto Alcibar, who abandoned his fast-paced life to become a certified instructor of mindfulness after an illness threw him into a period of acute stress.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">One way to reach a state of mindfulness is through meditation, which helps filter the information that reaches us from the outside world. It can also be achieved through breathing exercises, yoga, and body scans.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Achieving mindfulness involves a gradual process of training, but with a bit of practice we can learn to focus our mind completely, which reduces stress and helps us live longer.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-25\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_27\" title=\"27\"/>A little stress is good for you</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">While sustained, intense stress is a known enemy of longevity and both mental and physical health, low levels of stress have been shown to be beneficial.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">After observing a group of test subjects for more than twenty years, Dr. Howard S. Friedman, a psychology professor at the University of California, Riverside, discovered that people who maintained a low level of stress, who faced challenges and put their heart and soul into their work in order to succeed, lived longer than those who chose a more relaxed lifestyle and retired earlier. From this, he concluded that a small dose of stress is a positive thing, as those who live with low levels of stress tend to develop healthier habits, smoke less, and drink less alcohol.<a href=\"9781524704551_EPUB-24.xhtml#EndnoteNumber2\" id=\"SuperscriptNumber2\"><sup class=\"endnote\">2</sup></a></p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Given this, it is not surprising that many of the supercentenarians—people who live to be 110 or more—whom we’ll meet in this book talk about having lived intense lives and working well into old age.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-26\">A lot of sitting will age you</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">In the Western world in particular, the rise in sedentary behavior has led to numerous diseases such as hypertension and obesity, which in turn affect longevity.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_28\" title=\"28\"/>Spending too much time seated at work or at home not only reduces muscular and respiratory fitness but also increases appetite and curbs the desire to participate in activities. Being sedentary can lead to hypertension, imbalanced eating, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and even certain kinds of cancer. Recent studies have shown a connection between a lack of physical activity and the progressive distortion of telomeres in the immune system, which ages those cells and, in turn, the organism as a whole.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">This is a problem at all life stages, not only among adults. Sedentary children suffer from high rates of obesity and all its associated health issues and risks, which is why it’s so important to develop a healthy and active lifestyle at an early age.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">It’s easy to be less sedentary; it just takes a bit of effort and a few changes to your routine. We can access a more active lifestyle that makes us feel better inside and out—we just have to add a few ingredients to our everyday habits:</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<ul>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted-First\"><em>Walk to work, or just go on a walk</em> for at least twenty minutes each day.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted\"><em>Use your feet instead of an elevator or escalator.</em> This is good for your posture, your muscles, and your respiratory system, among other things.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted\"><em>Participate in social or leisure activities</em> so that you don’t spend too much time in front of the television.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted\"><em><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_29\" title=\"29\"/>Replace your junk food with fruit</em> and you’ll have less of an urge to snack, and more nutrients in your system.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted\"><em>Get the right amount of sleep.</em> Seven to nine hours is good, but any more than that makes us lethargic.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted\"><em>Play with children or pets, or join a sports team.</em> This not only strengthens the body but also stimulates the mind and boosts self-esteem.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted-Last\"><em>Be conscious of your daily routine</em> in order to detect harmful habits and replace them with more positive ones.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t</ul>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">By making these small changes, we can begin to renew our bodies and minds and increase our life expectancy.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-27\">A model’s best-kept secret</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">Though we age both externally and internally, both physically and mentally, one of the things that tell us the most about people’s age is their skin, which takes on different textures and colors according to processes going on beneath the surface. Most of those who make their living as models claim to sleep between nine and ten hours the night before a fashion show. This gives their skin a taut, wrinkle-free appearance and a healthy, radiant glow.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Science has shown that sleep is a key antiaging tool, because when we sleep we generate melatonin, a hormone that <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_30\" title=\"30\"/>occurs naturally in our bodies. The pineal gland produces it from the neurotransmitter serotonin according to our diurnal and nocturnal rhythms, and it plays a role in our sleep and waking cycles.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">A powerful antioxidant, melatonin helps us live longer, and also offers the following benefits:</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<ul>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted-First\">It strengthens the immune system.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted\">It contains an element that protects against cancer.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted\">It promotes the natural production of insulin.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted\">It slows the onset of Alzheimer’s disease.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted-Last\">It helps prevent osteoporosis and fight heart disease.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t</ul>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-Space\">For all these reasons, melatonin is a great ally in preserving youth. It should be noted, however, that melatonin production decreases after age thirty. We can compensate for this by:</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<ul>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted-First\">Eating a balanced diet and getting more calcium.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted\">Soaking up a moderate amount of sun each day.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted\">Getting enough sleep.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t\t<li class=\"x07-List-Bulleted-Last\">Avoiding stress, alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine, all of which make it harder to get a good night’s rest, depriving us of the melatonin we need.</li>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t</ul>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-Space\"><span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_31\" title=\"31\"/>Experts are trying to determine whether artificially stimulating production of melatonin might help slow the aging process . . . which would confirm the theory that we already carry the secret to longevity within us.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-28\">Antiaging attitudes</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">The mind has tremendous power over the body and how quickly it ages. Most doctors agree that the secret to keeping the body young is keeping the mind active—a key element of <em>ikigai</em>—and in not caving in when we face difficulties throughout our lives.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">One study, conducted at Yeshiva University, found that the people who live the longest have two dispositional traits in common: a <em>positive attitude</em> and a high degree of <em>emotional awareness</em>. In other words, those who face challenges with a positive outlook and are able to manage their emotions are already well on their way toward longevity.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">A <em>stoic attitude</em>—serenity in the face of a setback—can also help keep you young, as it lowers anxiety and stress levels and stabilizes behavior. This can be seen in the greater life expectancies of certain cultures with unhurried, deliberate lifestyles.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Many centenarians and supercentenarians have similar <span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pageMap_32\" title=\"32\"/>profiles: They have had full lives that were difficult at times, but they knew how to approach these challenges with a positive attitude and not be overwhelmed by the obstacles they faced.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text\">Alexander Imich, who in 2014 became the world’s oldest living man at age 111, knew he had good genes but understood that other factors contributed, too: “The life you live is equally or more important for longevity,” he said in an interview with Reuters after being added to <em>Guinness World Records </em>in 2014.</p>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<h2 class=\"x05-Head-A\" id=\"_idParaDest-29\">An ode to longevity</h2>&#13;\n",
      "\t\t\t<p class=\"x04-Body-Text-FL\">During our stay in Ogimi, the village that holds the Guinness record for longevity, a woman who was about to turn 100 years old sang the following song for us in a mixture of Japanese and the local dialect:</p>&#13;\n",

Then a mutual acquaintance put us in touch, launching a friendship that led to this project and seems destined to last a lifetime.The next time we got together, a year later, we strolled through a park in downtown Tokyo and ended up talking about trends in Western psychology, specifically logotherapy, which helps people find their purpose in life.We remarked that Viktor Frankl’s logotherapy had gone out of fashion among practicing therapists, who favored other schools of psychology, though people still search for meaning in what they do and how they live. We ask ourselves things like:What is the meaning of my life?Is the point just to live longer, or should I seek a higher purpose?Why do some people know what they want and have a passion for life, while others languish in confusion?At some point in our conversation, the mysterious word ikigai came up.This Japanese concept, which translates roughly as “the happiness of always being busy,” is like logotherapy, but it goes a step beyond. It also seems to be one way of explaining the extraordinary longevity of the Japanese, especially on the island of Okinawa, where there are 24.55 people over the age of 100 for every 100,000 inhabitants—far more than the global average.Those who study why the inhabitants of this island in the south of Japan live longer than people anywhere else in the world believe that one of the keys—in addition to a healthful diet, a simple life in the outdoors, green tea, and the subtropical climate (its average temperature is like that of Hawaii)—is the ikigai that shapes their lives.While researching this concept, we discovered that not a single book in the fields of psychology or personal development is dedicated to bringing this philosophy to the West.Is ikigai the reason there are more centenarians in Okinawa than anywhere else? How does it inspire people to stay active until the very end? What is the secret to a long and happy life?As we explored the matter further, we discovered that one place in particular, Ogimi, a rural town on the north end of the island with a population of three thousand, boasts the highest life expectancy in the world—a fact that has earned it the nickname the Village of Longevity.Okinawa is where most of Japan’s shikuwasa—a limelike fruit that packs an extraordinary antioxidant punch—comes from. Could that be Ogimi’s secret to long life? Or is it the purity of the water used to brew its Moringa tea?We decided to go study the secrets of the Japanese centenarians in person. After a year of preliminary research we arrived in the village—where residents speak an ancient dialect and practice an animist religion that features long-haired forest sprites called bunagaya—with our cameras and recording devices in hand. As soon as we arrived we could sense the incredible friendliness of its residents, who laughed and joked incessantly amid lush green hills fed by crystalline waters.As we conducted our interviews with the eldest residents of the town, we realized that something far more powerful than just these natural resources was at work: an uncommon joy flows from its inhabitants and guides them through the long and pleasurable journey of their lives.Again, the mysterious ikigai.But what is it, exactly? How do you get it?It never ceased to surprise us that this haven of nearly eternal life was located precisely in Okinawa, where two hundred thousand innocent lives were lost at the end of World War II. Rather than harbor animosity toward outsiders, however, Okinawans live by the principle of ichariba chode, a local expression that means “treat everyone like a brother, even if you’ve never met them before.”It turns out that one of the secrets to happiness of Ogimi’s residents is feeling like part of a community. From an early age they practice yuimaaru, or teamwork, and so are used to helping one another.Nurturing friendships, eating light, getting enough rest, and doing regular, moderate exercise are all part of the equation of good health, but at the heart of the joie de vivre that inspires these centenarians to keep celebrating birthdays and cherishing each new day is their ikigai.The purpose of this book is to bring the secrets of Japan’s centenarians to you and give you the tools to find your own ikigai.Because those who discover their ikigai have everything they need for a long and joyful journey through life.Happy travels!HÉCTOR GARCÍA AND FRANCESC MIRALLESWhat is your reason for being?According to the Japanese, everyone has an ikigai—what a French philosopher might call a raison d’être. Some people have found their ikigai, while others are still looking, though they carry it within them.Our ikigai is hidden deep inside each of us, and finding it requires a patient search. According to those born on Okinawa, the island with the most centenarians in the world, our ikigai is the reason we get up in the morning.Having a clearly defined ikigai brings satisfaction, happiness, and meaning to our lives. The purpose of this book is to help you find yours, and to share insights from Japanese philosophy on the lasting health of body, mind, and spirit.One surprising thing you notice, living in Japan, is how active people remain after they retire. In fact, many Japanese people never really retire—they keep doing what they love for as long as their health allows.There is, in fact, no word in Japanese that means retire in the sense of “leaving the workforce for good” as in English. According to Dan Buettner, a National Geographic reporter who knows the country well, having a purpose in life is so important in Japanese culture that our idea of retirement simply doesn’t exist there.Certain longevity studies suggest that a strong sense of community and a clearly defined ikigai are just as important as the famously healthful Japanese diet—perhaps even more so. Recent medical studies of centenarians from Okinawa and other so-called Blue Zones—the geographic regions where people live longest—provide a number of interesting facts about these extraordinary human beings:In Japanese, ikigai is written as 生き甲斐, combining 生き, which means “life,” with 甲斐, which means “to be worthwhile.” 甲斐 can be broken down into the characters 甲, which means “armor,” “number one,” and “to be the first” (to head into battle, taking initiative as a leader), and 斐, which means “beautiful” or “elegant.”Though we will consider each of these findings over the course of the book, research clearly indicates that the Okinawans’ focus on ikigai gives a sense of purpose to each and every day and plays an important role in their health and longevity.Okinawa holds first place among the world’s Blue Zones. In Okinawa, women in particular live longer and have fewer diseases than anywhere else in the world. The five regions identified and analyzed by Dan Buettner in his book The Blue Zones are:In the following chapters, we will examine several factors that seem to be the keys to longevity and are found across the Blue Zones, paying special attention to Okinawa and its so-called Village of Longevity. First, however, it is worth pointing out that three of these regions are islands, where resources can be scarce and communities have to help one another.For many, helping others might be an ikigai strong enough to keep them alive.According to scientists who have studied the five Blue Zones, the keys to longevity are diet, exercise, finding a purpose in life (an ikigai), and forming strong social ties—that is, having a broad circle of friends and good family relations.Members of these communities manage their time well in order to reduce stress, consume little meat or processed foods, and drink alcohol in moderation.1They don’t do strenuous exercise, but they do move every day, taking walks and working in their vegetable gardens. People in the Blue Zones would rather walk than drive. Gardening, which involves daily low-intensity movement, is a practice almost all of them have in common.One of the most common sayings in Japan is “Hara hachi bu,” which is repeated before or after eating and means something like “Fill your belly to 80 percent.” Ancient wisdom advises against eating until we are full. This is why Okinawans stop eating when they feel their stomachs reach 80 percent of their capacity, rather than overeating and wearing down their bodies with long digestive processes that accelerate cellular oxidation.Of course, there is no way to know objectively if your stomach is at 80 percent capacity. The lesson to learn from this saying is that we should stop eating when we are starting to feel full. The extra side dish, the snack we eat when we know in our hearts we don’t really need it, the apple pie after lunch—all these will give us pleasure in the short term, but not having them will make us happier in the long term.The way food is served is also important. By presenting their meals on many small plates, the Japanese tend to eat less. A typical meal in a restaurant in Japan is served in five plates on a tray, four of them very small and the main dish slightly bigger. Having five plates in front of you makes it seem like you are going to eat a lot, but what happens most of the time is that you end up feeling slightly hungry. This is one of the reasons why Westerners in Japan typically lose weight and stay trim.Recent studies by nutritionists reveal that Okinawans consume a daily average of 1,800 to 1,900 calories, compared to 2,200 to 3,300 in the United States, and have a body mass index between 18 and 22, compared to 26 or 27 in the United States.The Okinawan diet is rich in tofu, sweet potatoes, fish (three times per week), and vegetables (roughly 11 ounces per day). In the chapter dedicated to nutrition we will see which healthy, antioxidant-rich foods are included in this 80 percent.It is customary in Okinawa to form close bonds within local communities. A moai is an informal group of people with common interests who look out for one another. For many, serving the community becomes part of their ikigai.The moai has its origins in hard times, when farmers would get together to share best practices and help one another cope with meager harvests.Members of a moai make a set monthly contribution to the group. This payment allows them to participate in meetings, dinners, games of go and shogi (Japanese chess), or whatever hobby they have in common.The funds collected by the group are used for activities, but if there is money left over, one member (decided on a rotating basis) receives a set amount from the surplus. In this way, being part of a moai helps maintain emotional and financial stability. If a member of a moai is in financial trouble, he or she can get an advance from the group’s savings. While the details of each moai’s accounting practices vary according to the group and its economic means, the feeling of belonging and support gives the individual a sense of security and helps increase life expectancy.•   •   •FOLLOWING THIS BRIEF introduction to the topics covered in this book, we look at a few causes of premature aging in modern life, and then explore different factors related to ikigai.What is logotherapy?A colleague once asked Viktor Frankl to define his school of psychology in a single phrase, to which Frankl replied, “Well, in logotherapy the patient sits up straight and has to listen to things that are, on occasion, hard to hear.” The colleague had just described psychoanalysis to him in the following terms: “In psychoanalysis, the patient lies down on a couch and tells you things that are, on occasion, hard to say.”Frankl explains that one of the first questions he would ask his patients was “Why do you not commit suicide?” Usually the patient found good reasons not to, and was able to carry on. What, then, does logotherapy do? 1The answer is pretty clear: It helps you find reasons to live.Logotherapy pushes patients to consciously discover their life’s purpose in order to confront their neuroses. Their quest to fulfill their destiny then motivates them to press forward, breaking the mental chains of the past and overcoming whatever obstacles they encounter along the way.A study conducted by Frankl in his Vienna clinic found that among both patients and personnel, around 80 percent believed that human beings needed a reason for living, and around 60 percent felt they had someone or something in their lives worth dying for.2The search for purpose became a personal, driving force that allowed Frankl to achieve his goals. The process of logotherapy can be summarized in these five steps:Frankl himself would live and die for his principles and ideals. His experiences as a prisoner at Auschwitz showed him that “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”3 It was something he had to go through alone, without any help, and it inspired him for the rest of his life.Ten Differences Between Psychoanalysis and LogotherapyPsychoanalysisLogotherapyThe patient reclines on a couch, like a patient.The patient sits facing the therapist, who guides him or her without passing judgment.Is retrospective: It looks to the past.Looks toward the future.Is introspective: It analyzes neuroses.Does not delve into the patient’s neuroses.The drive is toward pleasure.The drive is toward purpose and meaning.Centers on psychology.Includes a spiritual dimension.Works on psychogenic neuroses.Also works on noogenic, or existential, neuroses.Analyzes the unconscious origin of conflicts (instinctual dimension).Deals with conflicts when and where they arise (spiritual dimension).Limits itself to the patient’s instincts.Also deals with spiritual realities.Is fundamentally incompatible with faith.Is compatible with faith.Seeks to reconcile conflicts and satisfy impulses and instincts.Seeks to help the patient find meaning in his life and satisfy his moral principles.Existential frustration arises when our life is without purpose, or when that purpose is skewed. In Frankl’s view, however, there is no need to see this frustration as an anomaly or a symptom of neurosis; instead, it can be a positive thing—a catalyst for change.Logotherapy does not see this frustration as mental illness, the way other forms of therapy do, but rather as spiritual anguish—a natural and beneficial phenomenon that drives those who suffer from it to seek a cure, whether on their own or with the help of others, and in so doing to find greater satisfaction in life. It helps them change their own destiny.Logotherapy enters the picture if the person needs help doing this, if he needs guidance in discovering his life’s purpose and later in overcoming conflicts so he can keep moving toward his objective. In Man’s Search for Meaning, Frankl cites one of Nietzsche’s famous aphorisms: “He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how.”Based on his own experience, Frankl believed that our health depends on that natural tension that comes from comparing what we’ve accomplished so far with what we’d like to achieve in the future. What we need, then, is not a peaceful existence, but a challenge we can strive to meet by applying all the skills at our disposal.Existential crisis, on the other hand, is typical of modern societies in which people do what they are told to do, or what others do, rather than what they want to do. They often try to fill the gap between what is expected of them and what they want for themselves with economic power or physical pleasure, or by numbing their senses. It can even lead to suicide.Sunday neurosis, for example, is what happens when, without the obligations and commitments of the workweek, the individual realizes how empty he is inside. He has to find a solution. Above all, he has to find his purpose, his reason for getting out of bed—his ikigai.In a study conducted at the Vienna Polyclinic Hospital, Frankl’s team found that 55 percent of the patients they interviewed were experiencing some degree of existential crisis.4According to logotherapy, discovering one’s purpose in life helps an individual fill that existential void. Frankl, a man who faced his problems and turned his objectives into actions, could look back on his life in peace as he grew old. He did not have to envy those still enjoying their youth, because he had amassed a broad set of experiences that showed he had lived for something.In the pages that follow, we will look at four cases from Frankl’s own practice in order to better understand the search for meaning and purpose.In German concentration camps, as in those that would later be built in Japan and Korea, psychiatrists confirmed that the prisoners with the greatest chance of survival were those who had things they wanted to accomplish outside the camp, those who felt a strong need to get out of there alive. This was true of Frankl, who, after being released and successfully developing the school of logotherapy, realized he had been the first patient of his own practice.Frankl had a goal to achieve, and it made him persevere. He arrived at Auschwitz carrying a manuscript that contained all the theories and research he had compiled over the course of his career, ready for publication. When it was confiscated, he felt compelled to write it all over again, and that need drove him and gave his life meaning amid the constant horror and doubt of the concentration camp—so much so that over the years, and especially when he fell ill with typhus, he would jot down fragments and key words from the lost work on any scrap of paper he found.An important North American diplomat went to Frankl to pick up where he left off with a course of treatment he had started five years earlier in the United States. When Frankl asked him why he’d started therapy in the first place, the diplomat answered that he hated his job and his country’s international policies, which he had to follow and enforce. His American psychoanalyst, whom he’d been seeing for years, insisted he make peace with his father so that his government and his job, both representations of the paternal figure, would seem less disagreeable. Frankl, however, showed him in just a few sessions that his frustration was due to the fact that he wanted to pursue a different career, and the diplomat concluded his treatment with that idea in mind.Five years later, the former diplomat informed Frankl that he had been working during that time in a different profession, and that he was happy.In Frankl’s view, the man not only didn’t need all those years of psychoanalysis, he also couldn’t even really be considered a “patient” in need of therapy. He was simply someone in search of a new life’s purpose; as soon as he found it, his life took on deeper meaning.The mother of a boy who had died at age eleven was admitted to Frankl’s clinic after she tried to kill herself and her other son. It was this other son, paralyzed since birth, who kept her from carrying out her plan: He did believe his life had a purpose, and if his mother killed them both, it would keep him from achieving his goals.The woman shared her story in a group session. To help her, Frankl asked another woman to imagine a hypothetical situation in which she lay on her deathbed, old and wealthy but childless. The woman insisted that, in that case, she would have felt her life had been a failure.When the suicidal mother was asked to perform the same exercise, imagining herself on her deathbed, she looked back and realized that she had done everything in her power for her children—for both of them. She had given her paralyzed son a good life, and he had turned into a kind, reasonably happy person. To this she added, crying, “As for myself, I can look back peacefully on my life; for I can say my life was full of meaning, and I have tried hard to live it fully; I have done my best—I have done my best for my son. My life was no failure!”In this way, by imagining herself on her deathbed and looking back, the suicidal mother found the meaning that, though she was not aware of it, her life already had.An elderly doctor, unable to overcome the deep depression into which he’d fallen after the death of his wife two years earlier, went to Frankl for help.Instead of giving him advice or analyzing his condition, Frankl asked him what would have happened if he had been the one who died first. The doctor, horrified, answered that it would have been terrible for his poor wife, that she would have suffered tremendously. To which Frankl responded, “You see, doctor? You have spared her all that suffering, but the price you have to pay for this is to survive, and mourn her.”The doctor didn’t say another word. He left Frankl’s office in peace, after taking the therapist’s hand in his own. He was able to tolerate the pain in place of his beloved wife. His life had been given a purpose.In the same decade that logotherapy came into being—a few years earlier, in fact—Shoma Morita created his own purpose-centered therapy, in Japan. It proved to be effective in the treatment of neurosis, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress.In addition to being a psychotherapist, Shoma Morita was a Zen Buddhist, and his therapy left a lasting spiritual mark on Japan.Many Western forms of therapy focus on controlling or modifying the patient’s emotions. In the West, we tend to believe that what we think influences how we feel, which in turn influences how we act. In contrast, Morita therapy focuses on teaching patients to accept their emotions without trying to control them, since their feelings will change as a result of their actions.In addition to accepting the patient’s emotions, Morita therapy seeks to “create” new emotions on the basis of actions. According to Morita, these emotions are learned through experience and repetition.Morita therapy is not meant to eliminate symptoms; instead it teaches us to accept our desires, anxieties, fears, and worries, and let them go. As Morita writes in his book Morita Therapy and the True Nature of Anxiety-Based Disorders, “In feelings, it is best to be wealthy and generous.”Morita explained the idea of letting go of negative feelings with the following fable: A donkey that is tied to a post by a rope will keep walking around the post in an attempt to free itself, only to become more immobilized and attached to the post. The same thing applies to people with obsessive thinking who become more trapped in their own suffering when they try to escape from their fears and discomfort.5Morita’s original treatment, which lasts fifteen to twenty-one days, consists of the following stages:Morita was a great Zen master of Naikan introspective meditation. Much of his therapy draws on his knowledge and mastery of this school, which centers on three questions the individual must ask him- or herself:Through these reflections, we stop identifying others as the cause of our problems and deepen our own sense of responsibility. As Morita said, “If you are angry and want to fight, think about it for three days before coming to blows. After three days, the intense desire to fight will pass on its own.”7Logotherapy and Morita therapy are both grounded in a personal, unique experience that you can access without therapists or spiritual retreats: the mission of finding your ikigai, your existential fuel. Once you find it, it is only a matter of having the courage and making the effort to stay on the right path.In the following chapters, we’ll take a look at the basic tools you’ll need to get moving along that path: finding flow in the tasks you’ve chosen to do, eating in a balanced and mindful way, doing low-intensity exercise, and learning not to give in when difficulties arise. In order to do this, you have to accept that the world—like the people who live in it—is imperfect, but that it is still full of opportunities for growth and achievement.Are you ready to throw yourself into your passion as if it were the most important thing in the world?We are what we repeatedly do.Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.—AristotleImagine you are skiing down one of your favorite slopes. Powdery snow flies up on both sides of you like white sand. Conditions are perfect.You are entirely focused on skiing as well as you can. You know exactly how to move at each moment. There is no future, no past. There is only the present. You feel the snow, your skis, your body, and your consciousness united as a single entity. You are completely immersed in the experience, not thinking about or distracted by anything else. Your ego dissolves, and you become part of what you are doing.This is the kind of experience Bruce Lee described with his famous “Be water, my friend.”We’ve all felt our sense of time vanish when we lose ourselves in an activity we enjoy. We start cooking and before we know it, several hours have passed. We spend an afternoon with a book and forget about the world going by until we notice the sunset and realize we haven’t eaten dinner. We go surfing and don’t realize how many hours we have spent in the water until the next day, when our muscles ache.The opposite can also happen. When we have to complete a task we don’t want to do, every minute feels like a lifetime and we can’t stop looking at our watch. As the quip attributed to Einstein goes, “Put your hand on a hot stove for a minute and it seems like an hour. Sit with a pretty girl for an hour, and it seems like a minute. That is relativity.”The funny thing is that someone else might really enjoy the same task, but we want to finish as quickly as possible.What makes us enjoy doing something so much that we forget about whatever worries we might have while we do it? When are we happiest? These questions can help us discover our ikigai.These questions are also at the heart of psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s research into the experience of being completely immersed in what we are doing. Csikszentmihalyi called this state “flow,” and described it as the pleasure, delight, creativity, and process when we are completely immersed in life.There is no magic recipe for finding happiness, for living according to your ikigai, but one key ingredient is the ability to reach this state of flow and, through this state, to have an “optimal experience.”In order to achieve this optimal experience, we have to focus on increasing the time we spend on activities that bring us to this state of flow, rather than allowing ourselves to get caught up in activities that offer immediate pleasure—like eating too much, abusing drugs or alcohol, or stuffing ourselves with chocolate in front of the TV.As Csikszentmihalyi asserts in his book Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience, flow is “the state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it.”It is not only creative professionals who require the high doses of concentration that promote flow. Most athletes, chess players, and engineers also spend much of their time on activities that bring them to this state.According to Csikszentmihalyi’s research, a chess player feels the same way upon entering a state of flow as a mathematician working on a formula or a surgeon performing an operation. A professor of psychology, Csikszentmihalyi analyzed data from people around the world and discovered that flow is the same among individuals of all ages and cultures. In New York and Okinawa, we all reach a state of flow in the same way.But what happens to our mind when we are in that state?When we flow, we are focused on a concrete task without any distractions. Our mind is “in order.” The opposite occurs when we try to do something while our mind is on other things.If you often find yourself losing focus while working on something you consider important, there are several strategies you can employ to increase your chances of achieving flow.According to researcher Owen Schaffer of DePaul University, the requirements for achieving flow are:Schaffer’s model encourages us to take on tasks that we have a chance of completing but that are slightly outside our comfort zone.Every task, sport, or job has a set of rules, and we need a set of skills to follow them. If the rules for completing a task or achieving a purpose are too basic relative to our skill set, we will likely get bored. Activities that are too easy lead to apathy.If, on the other hand, we assign ourselves a task that is too difficult, we won’t have the skills to complete it and will almost certainly give up—and feel frustrated, to boot.The ideal is to find a middle path, something aligned with our abilities but just a bit of a stretch, so we experience it as a challenge. This is what Ernest Hemingway meant when he said, “Sometimes I write better than I can.”2We want to see challenges through to the end because we enjoy the feeling of pushing ourselves. Bertrand Russell expressed a similar idea when he said, “To be able to concentrate for a considerable amount of time is essential to difficult achievement.”3If you’re a graphic designer, learn a new software program for your next project. If you’re a programmer, use a new programming language. If you’re a dancer, try to incorporate into your next routine a movement that has seemed impossible for years.Add a little something extra, something that takes you out of your comfort zone.Even doing something as simple as reading means following certain rules, having certain abilities and knowledge. If we set out to read a book on quantum mechanics for specialists in physics without being specialists in physics ourselves, we’ll probably give up after a few minutes. On the other end of the spectrum, if we already know everything a book has to tell us, we’ll get bored right away.However, if the book is appropriate to our knowledge and abilities, and builds on what we already know, we’ll immerse ourselves in our reading, and time will flow. This pleasure and satisfaction are evidence that we are in tune with our ikigai.EasyChallengingBeyond Our AbilitiesBoredomFlowAnxietyVideo games—played in moderation—board games, and sports are great ways to achieve flow, because the objective tends to be very clear: Beat your rival or your own record while following a set of explicitly defined rules.Unfortunately, the objective isn’t quite as clear in most situations.According to a study by Boston Consulting Group, when asked about their bosses, the number one complaint of employees at multinational corporations is that they don’t “communicate the team’s mission clearly,” and that, as a result, the employees don’t know what their objectives are.What often happens, especially in big companies, is that the executives get lost in the details of obsessive planning, creating strategies to hide the fact that they don’t have a clear objective. It’s like heading out to sea with a map but no destination.It is much more important to have a compass pointing to a concrete objective than to have a map. Joi Ito, director of the MIT Media Lab, encourages us to use the principle of “compass over maps” as a tool to navigate our world of uncertainty. In the book Whiplash: How to Survive Our Faster Future, he and Jeff Howe write, “In an increasingly unpredictable world moving ever more quickly, a detailed map may lead you deep into the woods at an unnecessarily high cost. A good compass, though, will always take you where you need to go. It doesn’t mean that you should start your journey without any idea where you’re going. What it does mean is understanding that while the path to your goal may not be straight, you’ll finish faster and more efficiently than you would have if you had trudged along a preplanned route.”In business, the creative professions, and education alike, it’s important to reflect on what we hope to achieve before starting to work, study, or make something. We should ask ourselves questions such as:Having a clear objective is important in achieving flow, but we also have to know how to leave it behind when we get down to business. Once the journey has begun, we should keep this objective in mind without obsessing over it.When Olympic athletes compete for a gold medal, they can’t stop to think how pretty the medal is. They have to be present in the moment—they have to flow. If they lose focus for a second, thinking how proud they’ll be to show the medal to their parents, they’ll almost certainly commit an error at a critical moment and will not win the competition.One common example of this is writer’s block. Imagine that a writer has to finish a novel in three months. The objective is clear; the problem is that the writer can’t stop obsessing over it. Every day she wakes up thinking, “I have to write that novel,” and every day she sets about reading the newspaper and cleaning the house. Every evening she feels frustrated and promises she’ll get to work the next day.Days, weeks, and months pass, and the writer still hasn’t gotten anything down on the page, when all it would have taken was to sit down and get that first word out, then the second . . . to flow with the project, expressing her ikigai.As soon as you take these first small steps, your anxiety will disappear and you will achieve a pleasant flow in the activity you’re doing. Getting back to Albert Einstein, “a happy man is too satisfied with the present to dwell on the future.”4Vague ObjectiveClearly Defined Objective and a Focus on ProcessObsessive Desire to Achieve a Goal While Ignoring ProcessConfusion; time and energy wasted on meaningless tasksFlowFixation on the objective rather than getting down to businessMental blockFlowMental blockThis is perhaps one of the greatest obstacles we face today, with so much technology and so many distractions. We’re listening to a video on YouTube while writing an e-mail, when suddenly a chat prompt pops up and we answer it. Then our smartphone vibrates in our pocket; just as soon as we respond to that message, we’re back at our computer, logging on to Facebook.Pretty soon thirty minutes have passed, and we’ve forgotten what the e-mail we were writing was supposed to be about.This also happens sometimes when we put on a movie with dinner and don’t realize how delicious the salmon was until we’re taking the last bite.We often think that combining tasks will save us time, but scientific evidence shows that it has the opposite effect. Even those who claim to be good at multitasking are not very productive. In fact, they are some of the least productive people.Our brains can take in millions of bits of information but can only actually process a few dozen per second. When we say we’re multitasking, what we’re really doing is switching back and forth between tasks very quickly. Unfortunately, we’re not computers adept at parallel processing. We end up spending all our energy alternating between tasks, instead of focusing on doing one of them well.Concentrating on one thing at a time may be the single most important factor in achieving flow.According to Csikszentmihalyi, in order to focus on a task we need:Technology is great, if we’re in control of it. It’s not so great if it takes control of us. For example, if you have to write a research paper, you might sit down at your computer and use Google to look up the information you need. However, if you’re not very disciplined, you might end up surfing the Web instead of writing that paper. In that case, Google and the Internet will have taken over, pulling you out of your state of flow.It has been scientifically shown that if we continually ask our brains to switch back and forth between tasks, we waste time, make more mistakes, and remember less of what we’ve done.Several studies conducted at Stanford University by Clifford Ivar Nass describe our generation as suffering from an epidemic of multitasking. One such study analyzed the behavior of hundreds of students, dividing them into groups based on the number of things they tended to do at once. The students who were the most addicted to multitasking typically alternated among more than four tasks; for example, taking notes while reading a textbook, listening to a podcast, answering messages on their smartphone, and sometimes checking their Twitter timeline.Each group of students was shown a screen with several red and several blue arrows. The objective of the exercise was to count the red arrows.At first, all the students answered correctly right away, without much trouble. As the number of blue arrows increased (the number of red arrows stayed the same; only their position changed), however, the students accustomed to multitasking had serious trouble counting the red arrows in the time allotted, or as quickly as the students who did not habitually multitask, for one very simple reason: They got distracted by the blue arrows! Their brains were trained to pay attention to every stimulus, regardless of its importance, while the brains of the other students were trained to focus on a single task—in this case, counting the red arrows and ignoring the blue ones.5Other studies indicate that working on several things at once lowers our productivity by at least 60 percent and our IQ by more than ten points.One study funded by the Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research found that a sample group of more than four thousand young adults between the ages of twenty and twenty-four who were addicted to their smartphones got less sleep, felt less connected to their community at school, and were more likely to show signs of depression.6Concentrating on a Single TaskMultitaskingMakes achieving flow more likelyMakes achieving flow impossibleIncreases productivityDecreases productivity by 60 percent (though it doesn’t seem to)Increases our power of retentionMakes it harder to remember thingsMakes us less likely to make mistakesMakes us more likely to make mistakesHelps us feel calm and in control of the task at handMakes us feel stressed by the sensation that we’re losing control, that our tasks are controlling usCauses us to become more considerate as we pay full attention to those around usCauses us to hurt those around us through our “addiction” to stimuli: always checking our phones, always on social media . . .Increases creativityReduces creativityWhat can we do to avoid falling victim to this flow-impeding epidemic? How can we train our brains to focus on a single task? Here are a few ideas for creating a space and time free of distractions, to increase our chances of reaching a state of flow and thereby getting in touch with our ikigai:Advantages of FlowDisadvantages of DistractionA focused mindA wandering mindLiving in the presentThinking about the past and the futureWe are free from worryConcerns about our daily life and the people around us invade our thoughtsThe hours fly byEvery minute seems endlessWe feel in controlWe lose control and fail to complete the task at hand, or other tasks or people keep us from our workWe prepare thoroughlyWe act without being preparedWe know what we should be doing at any given momentWe frequently get stuck and don’t know how to proceedOur mind is clear and overcomes all obstacles to the flow of thoughtWe are plagued by doubts, concerns, and low self-esteemIt’s pleasantIt’s boring and exhaustingOur ego fades: We are not the ones controlling the activity or task we’re doing—the task is leading usConstant self-criticism: Our ego is present and we feel frustratedWhat do takumis (artisans), engineers, inventors, and otakus (fans of anime and manga) have in common? They all understand the importance of flowing with their ikigai at all times.One widespread stereotype about people in Japan is that they’re exceptionally dedicated and hardworking, even though some Japanese people say they look like they’re working harder than they really are. There is no doubt, though, about their ability to be completely absorbed in a task, or about their perseverance when there is a problem to be solved. One of the first words one learns when starting Japanese lessons is ganbaru, which means “to persevere” or “to stay firm by doing one’s best.”Japanese people often apply themselves to even the most basic tasks with an intensity that borders on obsession. We see this in all kinds of contexts, from the “retirees” taking meticulous care of their rice fields in the mountains of Nagano to the college students working the weekend shift in convenience stores known as konbinis. If you go to Japan, you’ll experience this attention to detail firsthand in almost every transaction.Walk into one of the stores that sell handcrafted objects in Naha, Kanazawa, or Kyoto and you’ll also discover that Japan is a treasure trove of traditional craftwork. The people of Japan have a unique talent for creating new technologies while preserving artisanal traditions and techniques.Toyota employs “artisans” who are able to make a certain type of screw by hand. These takumi, or experts in a particular manual skill, are extremely important to Toyota, and they are hard to replace. Some of them are the only people who know how to perform their exact skill, and it doesn’t seem as though a new generation is going to take up the mantle.Turntable needles are another example: They’re produced almost exclusively in Japan, where you can find the last remaining people who know how to use the machinery required to make these precision needles, and who are trying to pass on their knowledge to their descendants.We met a takumi on a visit to Kumano, a small town near Hiroshima. We were there for the day, working on a photo essay for one of the most famous brands of makeup brushes in the West. The billboard welcoming visitors to Kumano shows a mascot holding a large brush. In addition to the brush factories, the town is full of little houses and vegetable gardens; heading farther in, you can see several Shinto shrines at the base of the mountains that surround the town.We spent hours taking photos in factories full of people in orderly rows, each doing a single task—such as painting the handles of the brushes or loading boxes of them onto trucks—before we realized we still hadn’t seen anyone actually putting bristles into the brush heads.After we asked about this and got the runaround several times, the president of one company agreed to show us how it was done. He led us out of the building and asked us to get into his car. After a five-minute drive we parked next to another, smaller structure and climbed the stairs. He opened a door and we walked into a small room filled with windows that let in lovely natural light.In the middle of the room was a woman wearing a mask. You could see only her eyes. She was so focused on choosing individual bristles for the brushes—gracefully moving her hands and fingers, using scissors and combs to sort the bristles—that she didn’t even notice our presence. Her movements were so quick it was hard to tell what she was doing.The president of the company interrupted her to let her know that we’d be taking photos as she worked. We couldn’t see her mouth, but the glint in her eye and the cheerful inflection in her speech let us know she was smiling. She looked happy and proud talking about her work and responsibilities.We had to use extremely fast shutter speeds to capture her movements. Her hands danced and flowed in concert with her tools and the bristles she was sorting.The president told us that this takumi was one of the most important people in the company, even though she was hidden away in a separate building. Every bristle of every brush the company made passed through her hands.Apple cofounder Steve Jobs was a big fan of Japan. Not only did he visit the Sony factories in the 1980s and adopt many of their methods when he founded Apple, he was also captivated by the simplicity and quality of Japanese porcelain in Kyoto.It was not, however, an artisan from Kyoto who won Steve Jobs’s devotion, but rather a takumi from Toyama named Yukio Shakunaga, who used a technique called Etchu Seto-yaki, known by only a few.On a visit to Kyoto, Jobs heard of an exhibition of Shakunaga’s work. He immediately understood that there was something special about Shakunaga’s porcelain. As a matter of fact, he bought several cups, vases, and plates, and went back to the show three times that week.Jobs returned to Kyoto several times over the course of his life in search of inspiration, and ended up meeting Shakunaga in person. It is said that Jobs had many questions for him—almost all of them about the fabrication process and the type of porcelain he used.Shakunaga explained that he used white porcelain he extracted himself from mountains in the Toyama prefecture, making him the only artist of his ilk familiar with the fabrication process of porcelain objects from their origins in the mountains to their final form—an authentic takumi.Jobs was so impressed that he considered going to Toyama to see the mountain where Shakunaga got his porcelain, but thought better of it when he heard that it was more than four hours by train from Kyoto.In an interview after Jobs’s death, Shakunaga said he was very proud that his work had been appreciated by the man who created the iPhone. He added that Jobs’s last purchase from him had been a set of twelve teacups. Jobs had asked for something special, “a new style.” To satisfy this request, Shakunaga made 150 teacups in the process of testing out new ideas. Of these, he chose the twelve best and sent them to the Jobs family.Ever since his first trip to Japan, Jobs was fascinated and inspired by the country’s artisans, engineers (especially at Sony), philosophy (especially Zen), and cuisine (especially sushi).7What do Japanese artisans, engineers, Zen philosophy, and cuisine have in common? Simplicity and attention to detail. It is not a lazy simplicity but a sophisticated one that searches out new frontiers, always taking the object, the body and mind, or the cuisine to the next level, according to one’s ikigai.As Csikszentmihalyi would say, the key is always having a meaningful challenge to overcome in order to maintain flow.The documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi gives us another example of a takumi, this time in the kitchen. Its protagonist has been making sushi every day for more than eighty years, and owns a small sushi restaurant near the Ginza subway station in Tokyo. He and his son go every day to the famous Tsukiji fish market and choose the best fish to bring back to the restaurant.In the documentary, we see one of Jiro’s apprentices learning to make tamago (a thin, slightly sweet omelet). No matter how hard he tries, he can’t get Jiro’s approval. He keeps practicing for years until he finally does.Why does the apprentice refuse to give up? Doesn’t he get bored cooking eggs every day? No, because making sushi is his ikigai, too.Both Jiro and his son are culinary artists. They don’t get bored when they cook—they achieve a state of flow. They enjoy themselves completely when they are in the kitchen; that is their happiness, their ikigai. They’ve learned to take pleasure in their work, to lose their sense of time.Beyond the close relationship between father and son, which helps them keep the challenge going each day, they also work in a quiet, peaceful environment that allows them to concentrate. Even after receiving a three-star rating from Michelin, they never considered opening other locations or expanding the business. They serve just ten patrons at a time at the bar of their small restaurant. Jiro’s family isn’t looking to make money; instead they value good working conditions and creating an environment in which they can flow while making the best sushi in the world.Jiro, like Yukio Shakunaga, begins his work at “the source.” He goes to the fish market to find the best tuna; Shakunaga goes to the mountains to find the best porcelain. When they get down to work, both become one with the object they are creating. This unity with the object that they reach in a state of flow takes on special meaning in Japan, where, according to Shintoism, forests, trees, and objects have a kami (spirit or god) within them.When someone—whether an artist, an engineer, or a chef—sets out to create something, his or her responsibility is to use nature to give it “life” while respecting that nature at every moment. During this process, the artisan becomes one with the object and flows with it. An ironworker would say that metal has a life of its own, just as someone making ceramics would say that the clay does. The Japanese are skilled at bringing nature and technology together: not man versus nature, but rather a union of the two.There are those who say that the Shinto value of being connected with nature is vanishing. One of the harshest critics of this loss is another artist with a clearly defined ikigai: Hayao Miyazaki, the director of the animated films produced by Studio Ghibli.In nearly all his films we see humans, technology, fantasy, and nature in a state of conflict—and, in the end, coming together. One of the most poignant metaphors in his film Spirited Away is an obese spirit covered in trash that represents the pollution of the rivers.In Miyazaki’s films, forests have personalities, trees have feelings, and robots befriend birds. Considered a national treasure by the Japanese government, Miyazaki is an artist capable of becoming completely absorbed in his art. He uses a cell phone from the late 1990s, and he makes his entire team draw by hand. He “directs” his films by rendering on paper even the tiniest detail, achieving flow by drawing, not by using a computer. Thanks to this obsession on the director’s part, Studio Ghibli is one of the only studios in the world where almost the entire production process is carried out using traditional techniques.Those who have visited Studio Ghibli know that it is fairly typical, on a given Sunday to see a solitary individual tucked away in a corner, hard at work—a man in simple clothes who will greet them with an ohayo (hello) without looking up.Miyazaki is so passionate about his work that he spends many Sundays in the studio, enjoying the state of flow, putting his ikigai above all else. Visitors know that under no circumstances is one to bother Miyazaki, who is known for his quick temper—especially if he is interrupted while drawing.In 2013, Miyazaki announced he was going to retire. To commemorate his retirement, the television station NHK made a documentary showing him in his last days at work. He is drawing in nearly every scene of the film. In one scene, several of his colleagues are seen coming out of a meeting, and there he is, drawing in a corner, paying no attention to them. In another scene, he is shown walking to work on December 30 (a national holiday in Japan) and opening the doors of Studio Ghibli so he can spend the day there, drawing alone.Miyazaki can’t stop drawing. The day after his “retirement,” instead of going on vacation or staying at home, he went to Studio Ghibli and sat down to draw. His colleagues put on their best poker faces, not knowing what to say. One year later, he announced he wouldn’t make any more feature films but that he would keep on drawing until the day he died.Can someone really retire if he is passionate about what he does?It is not only the Japanese who have this capacity; there are artists and scientists all over the world with strong, clear ikigais. They do what they love until their dying day.The last thing Einstein wrote before closing his eyes forever was a formula that attempted to unite all the forces of the universe in a single theory. When he died, he was still doing what he loved. If he hadn’t been a physicist, he said, he would have been happy as a musician. When he wasn’t focused on physics or mathematics, he enjoyed playing the violin. Reaching a state of flow while working on his formulas or playing music, his two ikigais, brought him endless pleasure.Many such artists might seem misanthropic or reclusive, but what they are really doing is protecting the time that brings them happiness, sometimes at the expense of other aspects of their lives. They are outliers who apply the principles of flow to their lives to an extreme.Another example of this kind of artist is the novelist Haruki Murakami. He sees only a close circle of friends, and appears in public in Japan only once every few years.Artists know how important it is to protect their space, control their environment, and be free of distractions if they want to flow with their ikigai.But what happens when we have to, say, do the laundry, mow the lawn, or attend to paperwork? Is there a way to make these mundane tasks enjoyable?Near the Shinjuku subway station, in one of the neural centers of Tokyo, there is a supermarket that still employs elevator operators. The elevators are fairly standard and could easily be operated by the customers, but the store prefers to provide the service of someone holding the door open for you, pushing the button for your floor, and bowing as you exit.If you ask around, you’ll learn that there is one elevator operator who has been doing the same job since 2004. She is always smiling and enthusiastic about her work. How is she able to enjoy such a job? Doesn’t she get bored doing something so repetitive?On closer inspection, it becomes clear that the elevator operator is not just pushing buttons but is instead performing a whole sequence of movements. She begins by greeting the customers with a songlike salutation followed by a bow and a welcoming wave of the hand. Then she presses the elevator button with a graceful movement, as though she is a geisha offering a client a cup of tea.Csikszentmihalyi calls this microflow.We’ve all been bored in a class or at a conference and started doodling to keep ourselves entertained. Or whistled while painting a wall. If we’re not truly being challenged, we get bored and add a layer of complexity to amuse ourselves. Our ability to turn routine tasks into moments of microflow, into something we enjoy, is key to our being happy, since we all have to do such tasks.Even Bill Gates washes the dishes every night. He says he enjoys it—that it helps him relax and clear his mind, and that he tries to do it a little better each day, following an established order or set of rules he’s made for himself: plates first, forks second, and so on.It’s one of his daily moments of microflow.Richard Feynman, one of the most important physicists of all time, also took pleasure in routine tasks. W. Daniel Hillis, one of the founders of the supercomputer manufacturer Thinking Machines, hired Feynman to work on the development of a computer that could handle parallel processing when he was already world famous. He says Feynman showed up on his first day of work and said, “OK, boss, what’s my assignment?” They didn’t have anything prepared, so they asked him to work on a certain mathematical problem. He immediately realized they were giving him an irrelevant task to keep him busy and said, “That sounds like a bunch of baloney—give me something real to do.”So they sent him to a nearby shop to buy office supplies, and he completed his assignment with a smile on his face. When he didn’t have something important to do or needed to rest his mind, Feynman dedicated himself to microflowing—say, painting the office walls.Weeks later, after visiting the Thinking Machines offices a group of investors declared, “You have a Nobel laureate in there painting walls and soldering circuits.”8Training the mind can get us to a place of flow more quickly. Meditation is one way to exercise our mental muscles.There are many types of meditation, but they all have the same objective: calming the mind, observing our thoughts and emotions, and centering our focus on a single object.The basic practice involves sitting with a straight back and focusing on your breath. Anyone can do it, and you feel a difference after just one session. By fixing your attention on the air moving in and out of your nose, you can slow the torrent of thoughts and clear your mental horizons.The winner of the 1988 Olympic gold medal for archery was a seventeen-year-old woman from South Korea. When asked how she prepared, she replied that the most important part of her training was meditating for two hours each day.If we want to get better at reaching a state of flow, meditation is an excellent antidote to our smartphones and their notifications constantly clamoring for our attention.One of the most common mistakes among people starting to meditate is worrying about doing it “right,” achieving absolute mental silence, or reaching “nirvana.” The most important thing is to focus on the journey.Since the mind is a constant swirl of thoughts, ideas, and emotions, slowing down the “centrifuge”—even for just a few seconds—can help us feel more rested and leave us with a sense of clarity.In fact, one of the things we learn in the practice of meditation is not to worry about anything that flits across our mental screen. The idea of killing our boss might flash into our mind, but we simply label it as a thought and let it pass like a cloud, without judging or rejecting it. It is only a thought—one of the sixty thousand we have every day, according to some experts.Meditation generates alpha and theta brain waves. For those experienced in meditation, these waves appear right away, while it might take a half hour for a beginner to experience them. These relaxing brain waves are the ones that are activated right before we fall asleep, as we lie in the sun, or right after taking a hot bath.We all carry a spa with us everywhere we go. It’s just a matter of knowing how to get in—something anyone can do, with a bit of practice.Life is inherently ritualistic. We could argue that humans naturally follow rituals that keep us busy. In some modern cultures, we have been forced out of our ritualistic lives to pursue goal after goal in order to be seen as successful. But throughout history, humans have always been busy. We were hunting, cooking, farming, exploring, and raising families—activities that were structured as rituals to keep us busy throughout our days.But in an unusual way, rituals still permeate daily life and business practices in modern Japan. The main religions in Japan—Confucianism, Buddhism, and Shintoism—are all ones in which the rituals are more important than absolute rules.When doing business in Japan, process, manners, and how you work on something is more important than the final results. Whether this is good or bad for the economy is beyond the scope of this book. What is indisputable, though, is that finding flow in a “ritualistic workplace” is much easier than in one in which we are continually stressed out trying to achieve unclear goals set by our bosses.Rituals give us clear rules and objectives, which help us enter a state of flow. When we have only a big goal in front of us, we might feel lost or overwhelmed by it; rituals help us by giving us the process, the substeps, on the path to achieving a goal. When confronted with a big goal, try to break it down into parts and then attack each part one by one.Focus on enjoying your daily rituals, using them as tools to enter a state of flow. Don’t worry about the outcome—it will come naturally. Happiness is in the doing, not in the result. As a rule of thumb, remind yourself: “Rituals over goals.”The happiest people are not the ones who achieve the most. They are the ones who spend more time than others in a state of flow.After reading this chapter you should have a better idea of which activities in your life make you enter flow. Write all of them on a piece of paper, then ask yourself these questions: What do the activities that drive you to flow have in common? Why do those activities drive you to flow? For example, are all the activities you most like doing ones that you practice alone or with other people? Do you flow more when doing things that require you to move your body or just to think?In the answers to these questions you might find the underlying ikigai that drives your life. If you don’t, then keep searching by going deeper into what you like by spending more of your time in the activities that make you flow. Also, try new things that are not on the list of what makes you flow but that are similar and that you are curious about. For example, if photography is something that drives you into flow, you could also try painting; you might even like it more! Or if you love snowboarding and have never tried surfing . . .Flow is mysterious. It is like a muscle: the more you train it, the more you will flow, and the closer you will be to your ikigai.WHEN WE STARTED working on this book, we didn’t want to just research the factors that contribute to a long and happy life; we wanted to hear from the true masters of this art.The interviews we conducted in Okinawa merit their own chapter, but in the section that precedes it we have provided an overview of the life philosophies of a few international champions of longevity. We’re talking about supercentenarians—people who live to 110 years of age or more.The term was coined in 1970 by Norris McWhirter, editor of The Guinness Book of World Records. Its use became more widespread in the 1990s, after it appeared in William Strauss and Neil Howe’s Generations. Today there are an estimated 300 to 450 supercentenarians in the world, although the age of only around 75 of them has been confirmed. They aren’t superheroes, but we could see them as such for having spent far more time on this planet than the average life expectancy would predict.Given the rise in life expectancy around the world, the number of supercentenarians might also increase. A healthy and purposeful life could help us join their ranks.Let’s take a look at what a few of them have to say.According to the Gerontology Research Group, until April 2015, the oldest living person in the world was Misao Okawa, who passed away in a care facility in Osaka, Japan, after living for 117 years and 27 days.The daughter of a textile merchant, she was born in 1898, when Spain lost its colonies in Cuba and the Philippines, and the United States annexed Hawaii and launched Pepsi-Cola. Until she was 110, this woman—who lived in three different centuries—cared for herself unassisted.When specialists asked about her self-care routine, Misao answered simply, “Eating sushi and sleeping,” to which we should add, having a tremendous thirst for life. When they inquired about her secret for longevity, she answered with a smile, “I ask myself the same thing.”1Proof that Japan continues to be a factory of long life: In July of the same year Sakari Momoi passed away at 112 years and 150 days old. At the time he was the oldest man in the world, though he was younger than fifty-seven women.Born in Ecuador in 1889, María Capovilla was recognized by Guinness as the world’s oldest person. She died of pneumonia in 2006, at 116 years and 347 days old, leaving behind three children, twelve grandchildren, and twenty great- and great-great-grandchildren.She gave one of her last interviews at age 107, sharing her memories and her thoughts:I’m happy, and I give thanks to God, who keeps me going. I never thought I’d live so long, I thought I’d die long ago. My husband, Antonio Capovilla, was the captain of a ship. He passed away at 84. We had two daughters and a son, and now I have many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.Things were better, back in the old days. People behaved better. We used to dance, but we were more restrained; there was this one song I loved dancing to: “María” by Luis Alarcón. I still remember most of the words. I also remember many prayers, and say them every day.I like the waltz, and can still dance it. I also still make crafts, I still do some of the things I did when I was in school.2When she had finished recalling her past, she began to dance—one of her great passions—with an energy that made her seem decades younger.When asked about her secret for longevity, she responded simply, “I don’t know what the secret to long life is. The only thing I do is I’ve never eaten meat in my life. I attribute it to that.”Born in Arles, France, in February 1875, Jeanne Calment lived until August 4, 1997, making her, at 122, the oldest person of verified age in history. She jokingly said that she “competed with Methuselah,” and there is no question that she broke numerous records as she went on celebrating birthdays.She died of natural causes at the end of a happy life during which she denied herself almost nothing. She rode a bicycle until she turned 100. She lived on her own until 110, when she agreed to move into a nursing home after accidentally starting a small fire in her apartment. She stopped smoking at 120, when her cataracts started making it hard for her to bring a cigarette to her lips.One of her secrets may have been her sense of humor. As she said on her 120th birthday, “I see badly, I hear badly, and I feel bad, but everything’s fine.”3Born in Minnesota in 1896, Walter Breuning was able to see three centuries in his lifetime. He died in Montana in 2011, from natural causes; he’d had two wives and a fifty-year career on the railroad. At eighty-three he retired to an assisted living center in Montana, where he remained until his death. He is the second-oldest man (of verified age) ever born in the United States.He gave many interviews in his final years, insisting that his longevity stemmed from, among other things, his habit of eating only two meals per day and working for as many years as he could. “Your mind and your body. You keep both busy,” he said on his 112th birthday, “you’ll be here a long time.” Back then, he was still exercising every day.Among Breuning’s other secrets: He had a habit of helping others, and he wasn’t afraid of dying. As he declared in a 2010 interview with the Associated Press, “We’re all going to die. Some people are scared of dying. Never be afraid to die. Because you’re born to die.”4Before passing away in 2011, he is said to have told a pastor that he’d made a deal with God: If he wasn’t going to get better, it was time to go.Born in Poland in 1903, Alexander Imich was a chemist and parapsychologist residing in the United States who, after the death of his predecessor in 2014, became the oldest man of authenticated age in the world. Imich himself died shortly thereafter, in June of that year, leaving behind a long life rich with experiences.Imich attributed his longevity to, among other things, never drinking alcohol. “It’s not as though I’d won the Nobel Prize,” he said upon being declared the world’s oldest man. “I never thought I’d get to be so old.” When asked about his secret to living so long, his answer was “I don’t know. I just haven’t died yet.”5The secret to long life, however, is not held by supercentenarians alone. There are many people of advanced age who, though they haven’t made it into Guinness World Records, offer us inspiration and ideas for bringing energy and meaning to our lives.Artists, for example, who carry the torch of their ikigai instead of retiring, have this power.Art, in all its forms, is an ikigai that can bring happiness and purpose to our days. Enjoying or creating beauty is free, and something all human beings have access to.Hokusai, the Japanese artist who made woodblock prints in the ukiyo-e style and lived for 88 years, from the mid-eighteenth to the mid-nineteenth century, added this postscript to the first edition of his One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji:6All that I have produced before the age of 70 is not worth being counted. It is at the age of 73 that I have somewhat begun to understand the structure of true nature, of animals and grasses, and trees and birds, and fishes and insects; consequently at 80 years of age I shall have made still more progress; at 90 I hope to have penetrated into the mystery of things; at 100 years of age I should have reached decidedly a marvelous degree, and when I shall be 110, all that I do, every point and every line, shall be instinct with life.In the pages that follow, we’ve collected some of the most inspirational words from artists interviewed by Camille Sweeney for the New York Times.7 Of those still living, none have retired, and all still enjoy their passion, which they plan to pursue until their final breath, demonstrating that when you have a clear purpose, no one can stop you.The actor Christopher Plummer, still working at eighty-six, reveals a dark desire shared by many who love the profession: “We want to drop dead onstage. That would be a nice theatrical way to go.”8Osamu Tezuka, the father of modern Japanese manga, shared this feeling. Before he died in 1989, his last words as he drew one final cartoon were “Please, just let me work!”9The eighty-six-year-old filmmaker Frederick Wiseman declared on a stroll through Paris that he likes to work, which is why he does it with such intensity. “Everybody complains about their aches and pains and all that, but my friends are either dead or are still working,” he said.10Carmen Herrera, a painter who just entered her one hundredth year, sold her first canvas at age eighty-nine. Today her work is in the permanent collections of the Tate Modern and the Museum of Modern Art. When asked how she viewed her future, she responded, “I am always waiting to finish the next thing. Absurd, I know. I go day by day.”11“You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only love, you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your honour trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for it then—to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting.”—T. H. White, The Once and Future KingFor his part, naturalist and author Edward O. Wilson asserted, “I feel I have enough experience to join those who are addressing big questions. About ten years ago, when I began reading and thinking more broadly about the questions of what are we, where did we come from and where are we going, I was astonished at how little this was being done.”12Ellsworth Kelly, an artist who passed away in 2015 at the age of ninety-two, assured us that the idea that we lose our faculties with age is, in part, a myth, because instead we develop a greater clarity and capacity for observation. “It’s one thing about getting older, you see more. . . . Every day I’m continuing to see new things. That’s why there are new paintings.”13At eighty-six, the architect Frank Gehry reminds us that some buildings can take seven years “from the time you’re hired until you’re finished,”14 a fact that favors a patient attitude with regard to the passage of time. The man responsible for the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, however, knows how to live in the here and now: “You stay in your time. You don’t go backward. I think if you relate to the time you’re in, you keep your eyes and ears open, read the paper, see what’s going on, stay curious about everything, you will automatically be in your time.”15Because of its robust civil registry, many of those verified as having lived the longest are found in the United States; however, there are many centenarians living in remote villages in other countries. A peaceful life in the countryside seems pretty common among people who have watched a century pass.Without question, the international superstar of longevity is Japan, which has the highest life expectancy of any country in the world. In addition to a healthy diet, which we will explore in detail, and an integrated health care system in which people go to the doctor for regular checkups to prevent disease, longevity in Japan is closely tied to its culture, as we will see later on.The sense of community, and the fact that Japanese people make an effort to stay active until the very end, are key elements of their secret to long life.If you want to stay busy even when there’s no need to work, there has to be an ikigai on your horizon, a purpose that guides you throughout your life and pushes you to make things of beauty and utility for the community and yourself.TO GET TO Ogimi, we had to fly nearly three hours from Tokyo to Naha, the capital of Okinawa. Several months earlier we had contacted the town council of a place known as the Village of Longevity to explain the purpose of our trip and our intention to interview the oldest members of the community. After numerous conversations, we finally got the help we were looking for and were able to rent a house just outside the town.One year after starting this project, we found ourselves on the doorstep of some of the longest-living people in the world.We realized right away that time seems to have stopped there, as though the entire town were living in an endless here and now.After two hours on the road from Naha, we’re finally able to stop worrying about the traffic. To our left are the sea and an empty stretch of beach; to our right, the mountainous jungle of Okinawa’s Yanbaru forests.Once Route 58 passes Nago, where Orion beer—the pride of Okinawa—is made, it skirts the coast until it reaches Ogimi. Every now and then a few little houses and stores crop up in the narrow stretch of land between the road and the base of the mountain.We pass small clusters of houses scattered here and there as we enter the municipality of Ogimi, but the town doesn’t really seem to have a center. Our GPS finally guides us to our destination: the Center for the Support and Promotion of Well-Being, housed in an unattractive cinderblock building right off the highway.We go in through the back door, where a man named Taira is waiting for us. Beside him is a petite, cheerful woman who introduces herself as Yuki. Two other women immediately get up from desks and show us to a conference room. They serve us each a cup of green tea and a few shikuwasa, a small citrus fruit that packs a big nutritional punch, as we will see later on.Taira sits down across from us in his formal suit and opens up a large planner and a three-ring binder. Yuki sits next to him. The binder contains a list of all the town’s residents, organized by age and “club,” or moai. Taira points out that these groups of people who help one another are characteristic of Ogimi. The moai are not organized around any concrete objective; they function more like a family. Taira also tells us that volunteer work, rather than money, drives much of what happens in Ogimi. Everyone offers to pitch in, and the local government takes care of assigning tasks. This way, everyone can be useful and feels like a part of the community.Ogimi is the penultimate town before Cape Hedo, the northernmost point of the largest island in the archipelago.From the top of one of Ogimi’s mountains, we’re able to look down over the whole town. Almost everything is the green of the Yanbaru jungle, making us wonder where the nearly thirty-two hundred residents are hiding. We can see a few houses, but they’re scattered in little clusters near the sea or in small valleys accessible by side roads.We’re invited to eat in one of Ogimi’s few restaurants, but when we arrive the only three tables are already reserved.“Don’t worry, we’ll go to Churaumi instead. It never fills up,” says Yuki, walking back to her car.She’s still driving at age eighty-eight, and takes great pride in that. Her copilot is ninety-nine, and has also decided to spend the day with us. We have to drive fast to keep up with them on a highway that is sometimes more dirt than asphalt. Finally reaching the other end of the jungle, we can at last sit down to eat.“I don’t really go to restaurants,” Yuki says as we take our seats. “Almost everything I eat comes from my vegetable garden, and I buy my fish from Tanaka, who’s been my friend forever.”The restaurant is right by the sea and seems like something from the planet Tatooine, from Star Wars. The menu boasts in large letters that it serves “slow food” prepared with organic vegetables grown in the town.“But really,” Yuki continues, “food is the least important thing.” She is extroverted, and rather pretty. She likes to talk about her role as the director of several associations run by the local government.“Food won’t help you live longer,” she says, bringing to her lips a bite of the diminutive confection that followed our meal. “The secret is smiling and having a good time.”There are no bars and only a few restaurants in Ogimi, but those who live there enjoy a rich social life that revolves around community centers. The town is divided into seventeen neighborhoods, and each one has a president and several people in charge of things like culture, festivals, social activities, and longevity.Residents pay close attention to this last category.We’re invited to the community center of one of the seventeen neighborhoods. It is an old building right next to one of the mountains of the Yanbaru jungle, home to bunagaya, the town’s iconic sprites.Bunagaya are magical creatures that inhabit the Yanbaru jungle near Ogimi and its surrounding towns. They manifest as children with long red hair, and like to hide in the jungle’s gajumaru (banyan) trees and go fishing on the beach.Many of Okinawa’s stories and fables are about bunagaya sprites. They are mischievous, playful, and unpredictable. Locals say that the bunagaya love the mountains, rivers, sea, trees, earth, wind, and animals, and that if you want to befriend them, you have to show respect for nature.When we arrive at the neighborhood’s community center, we’re greeted by a group of about twenty people who proudly proclaim, “The youngest among us is eighty-three!”We conduct our interviews at a large table while drinking green tea. When we finish, we’re brought to an event space, where we celebrate the birthdays of three members of the group. One woman is turning ninety-nine, another ninety-four, and one “young man” has just reached eighty-nine.We sing a few songs popular in the village and finish up with “Happy Birthday” in English. The woman turning ninety-nine blows out the candles and thanks everyone for coming to her party. We eat homemade shikuwasa cake and end up dancing and celebrating as though it were the birthday of a twentysomething.It’s the first party, but not the last, that we’ll attend during our week in the village. We’ll also do karaoke with a group of seniors who sing better than we do, and attend a traditional festival with local bands, dancers, and food stands at the foot of a mountain.Celebrations seem to be an essential part of life in Ogimi.We’re invited to watch a game of gateball, one of the most popular sports among Okinawa’s older residents. It involves hitting a ball with a mallet-like stick. It is a low-impact sport that can be played anywhere, and is a good excuse to move around and have fun as a group. The residents hold local competitions, and there is no age limit for participants.We participate in the weekly game and lose to a woman who recently turned 104. Everyone cheers, and the defeated look on our faces elicits laughter.In addition to playing and celebrating as a community, spirituality is also essential to the happiness of the village’s residents.The main religion in Okinawa is known as Ryukyu Shinto. Ryukyu is the original name of the Okinawa archipelago, and Shinto means “the path of the gods.”1 Ryukyu Shinto combines elements of Chinese Taoism, Confucianism, Buddhism, and Shintoism with shamanistic and animistic elements.According to this ancient faith, the world is populated by an infinite number of spirits divided into several types: spirits of the home, of the forest, of the trees, and of the mountains. It is important to appease these spirits through rituals and festivals, and by consecrating sacred grounds.Okinawa is full of sacred jungles and forests, where many of the two main kinds of temples are found: the utaki and the uganju. We visited an uganju, or small, open-air temple adorned with incense and coins, next to a waterfall in Ogimi. The utaki is a collection of stones where people go to pray and where, supposedly, spirits gather.In Okinawa’s religious practice, women are considered spiritually superior to men, whereas the opposite is true of traditional Shintoism in the rest of Japan. Yuta are women chosen as mediums by their communities to make contact with the spirit realm through traditional rites.Ancestor worship is another important feature of spiritual practice in Okinawa, and in Japan in general. The home of each generation’s firstborn usually contains a butsudan, or small altar, used to pray for and make offerings to the family’s ancestors.Every person has an essence, or mabui. This mabui is our spirit and the source of our life force. It is immortal and makes us who we are.Sometimes, the mabui of someone who has died is trapped in the body of a living person. This situation requires a separation ritual to free the mabui of the deceased; it often happens when a person dies suddenly—especially at a young age—and his or her mabui does not want to move on to the realm of the dead.A mabui can also be passed from person to person by physical contact. A grandmother who leaves her granddaughter a ring transfers a part of her mabui to her. Photographs can also be a medium for passing mabui among people.Looking back, our days in Ogimi were intense but relaxed—sort of like the lifestyle of the locals, who always seemed to be busy with important tasks but who, upon closer inspection, did everything with a sense of calm. They were always pursuing their ikigai, but they were never in a rush.Not only did they seem to be happily busy, but we also noticed that they followed the other principles for happiness that Washington Burnap stated two hundred years ago: “The grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do, something to love, and something to hope for.”2On our last day, we went to buy gifts at a small market at the edge of town. The only things sold there are local vegetables, green tea, and shikuwasa juice, along with bottles of water from a spring hidden in the Yanbaru forests, bearing labels that read “Longevity Water.”We bought ourselves some of this Longevity Water and drank it in the parking lot, looking out over the sea and hoping that the little bottles that promised a magic elixir would bring us health and long life, and would help us find our own ikigai. Then we took a photo with a statue of a bunagaya, and walked up to it one last time to read the inscription:At 80 I am still a child.When I come to see you at 90,send me away to wait until I’m 100.The older, the stronger;let us not depend too much on our children as we age.If you seek long life and health, you are welcome in our village,where you will be blessed by nature,and together we will discover the secret to longevity.April 23, 1993Ogimi Federation of Senior Citizen ClubsOver the course of a week we conducted a total of one hundred interviews, asking the eldest members of the community about their life philosophy, their ikigai, and the secrets to longevity. We filmed these conversations with two cameras for use in a little documentary, and chose a few especially meaningful and inspiring statements to include in this section of the book.“The secret to a long life is not to worry. And to keep your heart young—don’t let it grow old. Open your heart to people with a nice smile on your face. If you smile and open your heart, your grandchildren and everyone else will want to see you.”“The best way to avoid anxiety is to go out in the street and say hello to people. I do it every day. I go out there and say, ‘Hello!’ and ‘See you later!’ Then I go home and care for my vegetable garden. In the afternoon, I spend time with friends.”“Here, everyone gets along. We try not to cause problems. Spending time together and having fun is the only thing that matters.”“I feel joy every morning waking up at six and opening the curtains to look out at my garden, where I grow my own vegetables. I go right outside to check on my tomatoes, my mandarin oranges . . . I love the sight of them—it relaxes me. After an hour in the garden I go back inside and make breakfast.”“I plant my own vegetables and cook them myself. That’s my ikigai.”“The key to staying sharp in old age is in your fingers. From your fingers to your brain, and back again. If you keep your fingers busy, you’ll live to see one hundred.”“I get up at four every day. I set my alarm for that time, have a cup of coffee, and do a little exercise, lifting my arms. That gives me energy for the rest of the day.”“I eat a bit of everything; I think that’s the secret. I like variety in what I eat; I think it tastes better.”“Working. If you don’t work, your body breaks down.”“When I wake up, I go to the butsudan and light incense. You have to keep your ancestors in mind. It’s the first thing I do every morning.”“I wake up every day at the same time, early, and spend the morning in my vegetable garden. I go dancing with my friends once a week.”“I do exercise every day, and every morning I go for a little walk.”“I never forget to do my taiso exercises when I get up.”“Eating vegetables—it helps you live longer.”“To live a long time you need to do three things: exercise to stay healthy, eat well, and spend time with people.”“Getting together with my friends is my most important ikigai. We all get together here and talk—it’s very important. I always know I’ll see them all here tomorrow, and that’s one of my favorite things in life.”“My main hobby is getting together with friends and neighbors.”“Talking each day with the people you love, that’s the secret to a long life.”“I say, ‘Hello!’ and ‘See you later!’ to the children on their way to school, and wave at everyone who goes by me in their car. ‘Drive safely!’ I say. Between 7:20 a.m. and 8:15 a.m., I’m outside on my feet the whole time, saying hello to people. Once everyone’s gone, I go back inside.”“Chatting and drinking tea with my neighbors. That’s the best thing in life. And singing together.”“I wake up at five every morning, leave the house, and walk to the sea. Then I go to a friend’s house and we have tea together. That’s the secret to long life: getting together with people, and going from place to place.”“My secret to a long life is always saying to myself, ‘Slow down,’ and ‘Relax.’ You live much longer if you’re not in a hurry.”“I make things with wicker. That’s my ikigai. The first thing I do when I wake up is pray. Then I do my exercises and eat breakfast. At seven I calmly start working on my wicker. When I get tired at five, I go visit my friends.”“Doing many different things every day. Always staying busy, but doing one thing at a time, without getting overwhelmed.”“The secret to long life is going to bed early, waking up early, and going for a walk. Living peacefully and enjoying the little things. Getting along with your friends. Spring, summer, fall, winter . . . enjoying each season, happily.”“Every day I say to myself, ‘Today will be full of health and energy. Live it to the fullest.’”“I’m ninety-eight, but consider myself young. I still have so much to do.”“Laugh. Laughter is the most important thing. I laugh wherever I go.”“I’m going to live to be a hundred. Of course I am! It’s a huge motivation for me.”“Dancing and singing with your grandchildren is the best thing in life.”“I feel very fortunate to have been born here. I give thanks for it every day.”“The most important thing in Ogimi, in life, is to keep smiling.”“I do volunteer work to give back to the village a bit of what it has given to me. For example, I use my car to help friends get to the hospital.”“There’s no secret to it. The trick is just to live.”ACCORDING TO THE World Health Organization, Japan has the highest life expectancy in the world: 85 years for men and 87.3 years for women. Moreover, it has the highest ratio of centenarians in the world: more than 520 for every million people (as of September 2016).Source: World Health Organization, 1966; Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, 2004; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services/CDC, 2005The above graphic, which compares life expectancy in Japan, its province Okinawa, Sweden, and the United States, shows that, while life expectancy in Japan is high overall, Okinawa exceeds the national average.Okinawa is one of the areas in Japan that were most affected by World War II. As a result not only of conflicts on the battlefield but also of hunger and a lack of resources once the war ended, the average life expectancy was not very high during the 1940s and 1950s. As Okinawans recovered from the destruction, however, they came to be some of the country’s longest-living citizens.What secrets to long life do the Japanese hold? What is it about Okinawa that makes it the best of the best in terms of life expectancy?Experts point out that, for one thing, Okinawa is the only province in Japan without trains. Its residents have to walk or cycle when not driving. It is also the only province that has managed to follow the Japanese government’s recommendation of eating less than ten grams of salt per day.The mortality rate from cardiovascular disease in Okinawa is the lowest in Japan, and diet almost certainly has a lot to do with this. It is no coincidence that the “Okinawa Diet” is so often discussed around the world at panels on nutrition.The most concrete and widely cited data on diet in Okinawa come from studies by Makoto Suzuki, a cardiologist at the University of the Ryukyus, who has published more than seven hundred scientific articles on nutrition and aging in Okinawa since 1970.Bradley J. Willcox and D. Craig Willcox joined Makoto Suzuki’s research team and published a book considered the bible on the subject, The Okinawa Program.1 They reached the following conclusions:In addition to these basic dietary principles, Okinawans eat fish an average of three times per week; unlike in other parts of Japan, the most frequently consumed meat is pork, though locals eat it only once or twice per week.Along these lines, Makoto Suzuki’s studies indicate the following:This brings us back to the 80 percent rule we mentioned in the first chapter, a concept known in Japanese as hara hachi bu. It’s easy to do: When you notice you’re almost full but could have a little more . . . just stop eating!One easy way to start applying the concept of hara hachi bu is to skip dessert. Or to reduce portion size. The idea is to still be a little bit hungry when you finish.This is why portion size tends to be much smaller in Japan than in the West. Food isn’t served as appetizers, main courses, and dessert. Instead, it’s much more common to see everything presented at once on small plates: one with rice, another with vegetables, a bowl of miso soup, and something to snack on. Serving food on many small plates makes it easier to avoid eating too much, and facilitates the varied diet discussed at the beginning of this chapter.Hara hachi bu is an ancient practice. The twelfth-century book on Zen Buddhism Zazen Youjinki recommends eating two-thirds as much as you might want to. Eating less than one might want is common among all Buddhist temples in the East. Perhaps Buddhism recognized the benefits of limiting caloric intake more than nine centuries ago.Few would challenge this idea. Without taking it to the extreme of malnutrition, of course, eating fewer calories than our bodies ask for seems to increase longevity. The key to staying healthy while consuming fewer calories is eating foods with a high nutritional value (especially “superfoods”) and avoiding those that add to our overall caloric intake but offer little to no nutritional value.The calorie restriction we’ve been discussing is one of the most effective ways to add years to your life. If the body regularly consumes enough, or too many, calories, it gets lethargic and starts to wear down, expending significant energy on digestion alone.Another benefit of calorie restriction is that it reduces levels of IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) in the body. IGF-1 is a protein that plays a significant role in the aging process; it seems that one of the reasons humans and animals age is an excess of this protein in their blood.2Whether calorie restriction will extend lifespan in humans is not yet known, but data increasingly indicate that moderate calorie restriction with adequate nutrition has a powerful protective effect against obesity, type 2 diabetes, inflammation, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease and reduces metabolic risk factors associated with cancer.3An alternative to following the 80 percent rule on a daily basis is to fast for one or two days each week. The 5:2 (or fasting) diet recommends two days of fasting (consuming fewer than five hundred calories) every week and eating normally on the other five days.Among its many benefits, fasting helps cleanse the digestive system and allows it to rest.Antioxidants are molecules that slow the oxidation process in cells, neutralizing the free radicals that cause damage and accelerate aging. The antioxidant power of green tea, for example, is well known, and will be discussed later at greater length.Because they are rich in antioxidants and are eaten nearly every day in the region, these fifteen foods are considered keys to Okinawan vitality:Okinawans drink more Sanpin-cha—a mix of green tea and jasmine flowers—than any other kind of tea. The closest approximation in the West would be the jasmine tea that usually comes from China. A 1988 study conducted by Hiroko Sho at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology indicates that jasmine tea reduces blood cholesterol levels.4Sanpin-cha can be found in many different forms in Okinawa, and is even available in vending machines. In addition to all the antioxidant benefits of green tea, it boasts the benefits of jasmine, which include:Okinawans drink an average of three cups of Sanpin-cha every day.It might be hard to find exactly the same blend in the West, but we can drink jasmine tea, or even a high-quality green tea, instead.Green tea has been credited for centuries with significant medicinal properties. Recent studies have confirmed its many benefits, and have attested to the importance of this ancient plant in the longevity of those who drink it often.Originally from China, where it has been consumed for millennia, green tea didn’t make its way to the rest of the world until just a few centuries ago. Unlike other teas, and as a result of being air-dried without fermentation, it retains its active elements even after being dried and crumbled. It offers meaningful health benefits such as:White tea, with its high concentration of polyphenols, may be even more effective against aging. In fact, it is considered to be the natural product with the greatest antioxidant power in the world—to the extent that one cup of white tea might pack the same punch as about a dozen glasses of orange juice.In summary: Drinking green or white tea every day can help us reduce the free radicals in our bodies, keeping us young longer.Shikuwasa is the citrus fruit par excellence of Okinawa, and Ogimi is its largest producer in all of Japan.The fruit is extremely acidic: It is impossible to drink shikuwasa juice without diluting it first with water. Its taste is somewhere between that of a lime and a mandarin orange, to which it bears a family resemblance.Shikuwasas also contain high levels of nobiletin, a flavonoid rich in antioxidants.All citrus fruits—grapefruits, oranges, lemons—are high in nobiletin, but Okinawa’s shikuwasas have forty times as much as oranges. Consuming nobiletin has been proven to protect us from arteriosclerosis, cancer, type 2 diabetes, and obesity in general.Shikuwasas also contain vitamins C and B1, beta carotene, and minerals. They are used in many traditional dishes and to add flavor to food, and are squeezed to make juice. While conducting research at the birthday parties of the town’s “grandparents,” we were served shikuwasa cake.In 2010 the UK’s Daily Mirror published a list of foods recommended by experts to combat aging. Among these foods readily available in the West are:Foods that should be eliminated are refined sugar and grains, processed baked goods, and prepared foods, along with cow’s milk and all its derivatives. Following this diet will help you feel younger and slow the process of premature aging.STUDIES FROM THE Blue Zones suggest that the people who live longest are not the ones who do the most exercise but rather the ones who move the most.When we visited Ogimi, the Village of Longevity, we discovered that even people over eighty and ninety years old are still highly active. They don’t stay at home looking out the window or reading the newspaper. Ogimi’s residents walk a lot, do karaoke with their neighbors, get up early in the morning, and, as soon as they’ve had breakfast—or even before—head outside to weed their gardens. They don’t go to the gym or exercise intensely, but they almost never stop moving in the course of their daily routines.“Metabolism slows down 90 percent after 30 minutes of sitting. The enzymes that move the bad fat from your arteries to your muscles, where it can get burned off, slow down. And after two hours, good cholesterol drops 20 percent. Just getting up for five minutes is going to get things going again. These things are so simple they’re almost stupid,” says Gavin Bradley1 in a 2015 interview with Brigid Schulte for the Washington Post.2 Bradley is one of the preeminent experts on the subject, and the director of an international organization dedicated to building awareness of how detrimental sitting all the time can be to our health.If we live in a city, we might find it hard to move in natural and healthy ways every day, but we can turn to exercises that have proven for centuries to be good for the body.The Eastern disciplines for bringing body, mind, and soul into balance have become quite popular in the West, but in their countries of origin they have been used for ages to promote health.Yoga—originally from India, though very popular in Japan—and China’s qigong and tai chi, among other disciplines, seek to create harmony between a person’s body and mind so they can face the world with strength, joy, and serenity.They are touted as elixirs of youth, and science has endorsed the claim.These gentle exercises offer extraordinary health benefits, and are particularly appropriate for older individuals who have a harder time staying fit.Tai chi has been shown, among other things, to slow the development of osteoporosis and Parkinson’s disease, to increase circulation, and to improve muscle tone and flexibility. Its emotional benefits are just as important: It is a great shield against stress and depression.You don’t need to go to the gym for an hour every day or run marathons. As Japanese centenarians show us, all you need is to add movement to your day. Practicing any of these Eastern disciplines on a regular basis is a great way to do so. An added benefit is that they all have well-defined steps, and as we saw in chapter IV, disciplines with clear rules are good for flow. If you don’t like any of these disciplines, feel free to choose a practice that you love and that makes you move.In the following pages we’ll take a look at some of the practices that promote health and longevity—but first, a little appetizer: a singularly Japanese exercise for starting your day.This morning warm-up has been around since before World War II. The “radio” part of its name is from when the instructions for each exercise were transmitted over the radio, but today people usually do these movements while tuned to a television channel or Internet video demonstrating the steps.One of the main purposes of doing radio taiso is to promote a spirit of unity among participants. The exercises are always done in groups, usually in schools before the start of classes, and in businesses before the workday begins.Statistics show that 30 percent of Japanese practice radio taiso for a few minutes every morning, but radio taiso is one thing that almost everyone we interviewed in Ogimi had in common. Even the residents of the nursing home we visited dedicated at least five minutes every day to it, though some did the exercises from their wheelchairs. We joined them on their daily practice and we felt refreshed for the rest of the day.When these exercises are done in a group, it is usually on a sports field or in a large reception hall, and typically involves some kind of loudspeaker.The exercises take five or ten minutes, depending on whether you do all or only some of them. They focus on dynamic stretching and increasing joint mobility. One of the most iconic radio taiso exercises consists of simply raising your arms above your head and then bringing them down in a circular motion. It is a tool to wake up the body, an easy mobility workout that is low in intensity and that focuses on exercising as many joints as possible.It might seem basic, but in our modern lives, we can spend days without raising our arms above our ears. Think about it: our arms are down when using computers, when using smartphones, when reading books. One of the few times we raise our hands over our heads is when reaching for something in a cupboard or closet, while our ancestors were raising their hands over their heads all the time when gathering things from trees. Radio taiso helps us to practice all the basic movements of the body.Basic version of the radio taiso exercises (5 minutes).Popular in Japan as well as in the West, yoga can be done by almost anyone. Some of its poses have even been adapted for pregnant women and practitioners with physical disabilities.Yoga comes from India, where it was developed millennia ago to unite our mental and physical elements. The word yoga itself comes from the Sanskrit term for “yoke,” which refers to the crosspiece that binds draft animals to one another and to the cart they’re pulling. Yoga strives to unite body and mind in the same way, guiding us toward a healthy lifestyle in harmony with the world around us.The main objectives of yoga are:Though all are oriented toward similar goals, there are many different types of yoga that vary according to the traditions and texts from which they were developed. The differences among them lie, as the masters say, in the path taken to the summit of our best self.The Sun Salutation is one of the most iconic exercises in hatha yoga. To do it, you simply have to follow these twelve basic movements:You’ve just greeted the sun; now you’re ready to have a fantastic day.Also known as t’ai chi ch’uan (or taijiquan), tai chi is a Chinese martial art that can be traced back hundreds of years to Buddhism and Confucianism; it is very popular in Japan, too.According to Chinese tradition, it was created by the Taoist master and martial arts practitioner Zhang Sanfeng, though it was Yang Luchan who in the nineteenth century brought the form to the rest of the world.Tai chi was originally a neijia, or internal martial art, meaning its goal was personal growth. Focused on self-defense, it teaches those who practice it to defeat their adversaries by using the least amount of force possible and by relying on agility.Tai chi, which was also seen as a means of healing body and mind, would go on to be used more frequently to foster health and inner peace. To encourage its citizens to be more active, the Chinese government promoted it as an exercise, and it lost its original connection to martial arts, becoming instead a source of health and well-being accessible to all.There are different schools and styles of tai chi. The following are the best known:Despite their differences, these styles all have the same objectives:According to the master Yang Chengfu, the correct practice of tai chi follows ten basic principles:One of the best-known movements in tai chi consists of following the form of clouds in an exercise called Wave Hands Like Clouds. Here are the steps:Also known as chi kung, its name combines qi (life force, or energy) and gong (work), indicating that the form works with the individual’s life force. Though relatively modern, especially under its current name, the art of qigong is based on the Tao yin, an ancient art meant to foster mental and physical well-being.The practice began to appear in reports on training and martial arts at the beginning of the twentieth century, and by the 1930s was being used in hospitals. The Chinese government later popularized it, as it had done with tai chi.Qigong involves static and dynamic physical exercises that stimulate respiration in a standing, seated, or reclined position. There are many different styles of qigong, but all of them seek to strengthen and regenerate qi. Though its movements are typically gentle, the practice is intense.According to numerous international scientific studies, qigong—like tai chi and yoga—offers significant health benefits. The following stand out among those proven through scientific research, as observed by Dr. Kenneth M. Sancier of San Francisco’s Qigong Institute in his article “Medical Applications of Qigong”3:Practicing these arts not only keeps us in shape, it also helps extend our lives.In order to practice qigong correctly, we should remember that our life energy flows through our whole body. We should know how to regulate its many parts:In this way, the whole organism will be prepared to work together toward a single goal.One of qigong’s best-known exercises is a series representing the five elements: earth, water, wood, metal, and fire. This series of movements seeks to balance the five currents of energy in order to improve brain and organ function.There are several ways to do these movements. In this case, we’re following the model of Professor María Isabel García Monreal from the Qigong Institute in Barcelona.EARTHWATERWOODMETALFIRECOMPLETING THE SERIESCreated in Japan in the early twentieth century, principally for the treatment of arthritis, shiatsu also works on energy flow through the application of pressure with the thumbs and the palms of the hands. In combination with stretching and breathing exercises, it seeks to create equilibrium among the different elements of the body.It is not important that a Tao Yin* have a name, is imitating something, or is engraved in jade. What is important is the technique and the essence of what is really practiced. Stretching and contracting, bending and lifting of the head, stepping, lying down, resting or standing, walking or stepping slowly, screaming or breathing—everything can be a Tao Yin.—Ge Hong5The book Xiuzhen shishu, known in the West as Ten Books on the Cultivation of Perfection, dates back to the thirteenth century and is a compendium of materials from diverse sources on developing the mind and body.It quotes, among others, the celebrated Chinese doctor and essayist Sun Simiao, who lived during the sixth century. Sun Simiao was a proponent of a technique called the Six Healing Sounds, which involves the coordination of movement, breathing, and pronouncing sounds with the purpose of bringing our souls to a place of calm.The six sounds are:Xu, pronounced like “shh” with a deep sigh, which is associated with the liverHe, pronounced like “her” with a yawn, which is associated with the heartSi, pronounced like “sir” with a slow exhale, which is associated with the lungsChui, pronounced like “chwee” with a forceful exhale, which is associated with the kidneysHoo, pronounced like “who,” which is associated with the spleenXi, pronounced like “she, ” which connects the whole bodyThe following poem by Sun Simiao offers clues about how to live well according to the season. It reminds us of the importance of breathing, and suggests that as we breathe, we visualize the organs associated with each of the healing sounds.In spring, breathe xu for clear eyes and so wood can aid your liver.In summer, reach for he, so that heart and fire can be at peace.In fall, breathe si to stabilize and gather metal, keeping the lungs moist.For the kidneys, next, breathe chui and see your inner waters calm.The Triple Heater needs your xi to expel all heat and troubles.In all four seasons, take deep breaths so your spleen can process food.And, of course, avoid exhaling noisily; don’t let even your own ears hear you.The practice is most excellent and will help preserve your divine elixir.It might feel confusing to be presented with all the Eastern traditions we have introduced in this chapter. The takeaway is that they all combine a physical exercise with an awareness of our breath. These two components—movement and breath—help us to bring our consciousness in line with our body, instead of allowing our mind to be carried away by the sea of daily worries. Most of the time, we are just not aware enough of our breathing.What is resilience?One thing that everyone with a clearly defined ikigai has in common is that they pursue their passion no matter what. They never give up, even when the cards seem stacked against them or they face one hurdle after another.We’re talking about resilience, a concept that has become influential among psychologists.But resilience isn’t just the ability to persevere. As we’ll see in this chapter, it is also an outlook we can cultivate to stay focused on the important things in life rather than what is most urgent, and to keep ourselves from being carried away by negative emotions.In the final section of the chapter, we’ll explore techniques that go beyond resilience to cultivate antifragility.Sooner or later, we all have to face difficult moments, and the way we do this can make a huge difference to our quality of life. Proper training for our mind, body, and emotional resilience is essential for confronting life’s ups and downs.Nana korobi ya oki 七転び八起きFall seven times, rise eight.—Japanese proverbResilience is our ability to deal with setbacks. The more resilient we are, the easier it will be to pick ourselves up and get back to what gives meaning to our lives.Resilient people know how to stay focused on their objectives, on what matters, without giving in to discouragement. Their flexibility is the source of their strength: They know how to adapt to change and to reversals of fortune. They concentrate on the things they can control and don’t worry about those they can’t.In the words of the famous Serenity Prayer by Reinhold Niebuhr:God, give us grace to accept with serenitythe things that cannot be changed,Courage to change the thingswhich should be changed,and the Wisdom to distinguishthe one from the other.Siddhārtha Gautama (Buddha) was born a prince of Kapilavastu, Nepal, and grew up in a palace, surrounded by riches. At sixteen he married and had a child.Not satisfied by his family’s wealth, at twenty-nine he decided to try a different lifestyle and ran away from the palace to live as an ascetic. But it wasn’t asceticism that he was looking for; it didn’t offer the happiness and well-being he sought. Neither wealth nor extreme asceticism worked for him. He realized that a wise person should not ignore life’s pleasures. A wise person can live with these pleasures but should always remain conscious of how easy it is to be enslaved by them.Zeno of Citium began his studies with the Cynics. The Cynics also led ascetic lives, leaving behind all earthly pleasures. They lived in the street, and the only thing they owned was the clothing on their backs.Seeing that Cynicism did not give him a sense of well-being, Zeno abandoned its teachings to found the school of Stoicism, which centers on the idea that there is nothing wrong with enjoying life’s pleasures as long as they do not take control of your life as you enjoy them. You have to be prepared for those pleasures to disappear.The goal is not to eliminate all feelings and pleasures from our lives, as in Cynicism, but to eliminate negative emotions.Since their inception, one of the objectives of both Buddhism and Stoicism has been to control pleasure, emotions, and desires. Though the philosophies are very different, both aim to curb our ego and control our negative emotions.Both Stoicism and Buddhism are, at their roots, methods for practicing well-being.According to Stoicism, our pleasures and desires are not the problem. We can enjoy them as long as they don’t take control of us. The Stoics viewed those who were able to control their emotions as virtuous.We finally land our dream job, but after a little while we are already hunting for a better one. We win the lottery and buy a nice car but then decide we can’t live without a sailboat. We finally win the heart of the man or woman we’ve been pining for and suddenly find we have a wandering eye.People can be insatiable.The Stoics believed that these kinds of desires and ambitions are not worth pursuing. The objective of the virtuous person is to reach a state of tranquility (apatheia): the absence of negative feelings such as anxiety, fear, shame, vanity, and anger, and the presence of positive feelings such as happiness, love, serenity, and gratitude.In order to keep their minds virtuous, the Stoics practiced something like negative visualization: They imagined the worst thing that could happen in order to be prepared if certain privileges and pleasures were taken from them.To practice negative visualization, we have to reflect on negative events, but without worrying about them.Seneca, one of the richest men in ancient Rome, lived a life of luxury but was, nonetheless, an active Stoic. He recommended practicing negative visualization every night before falling asleep. In fact, he not only imagined these negative situations, he actually put them into practice—for example, by living for a week without servants, or the food and drink he was used to as a wealthy man. As a result, he was able to answer the question “What’s the worst thing that could happen?”In addition to negative visualization and not giving in to negative emotions, another central tenet of Stoicism is knowing what we can control and what we can’t, as we see in the Serenity Prayer.Worrying about things that are beyond our control accomplishes nothing. We should have a clear sense of what we can change and what we can’t, which in turn will allow us to resist giving in to negative emotions.In the words of Epictetus, “It’s not what happens to you, but how you react that matters.”1In Zen Buddhism, meditation is a way to become aware of our desires and emotions and thereby free ourselves from them. It is not simply a question of keeping the mind free of thoughts but instead involves observing our thoughts and emotions as they appear, without getting carried away by them. In this way, we train our minds not to get swept up in anger, jealousy, or resentment.One of the most commonly used mantras in Buddhism focuses on controlling negative emotions: “Oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ ,” in which oṃ is the generosity that purifies the ego, ma is the ethics that purifies jealousy, ṇi is the patience that purifies passion and desire, pad is the precision that purifies bias, me is the surrender that purifies greed, and hūṃ is the wisdom that purifies hatred.Another key to cultivating resilience is knowing in which time to live. Both Buddhism and Stoicism remind us that the present is all that exists, and it is the only thing we can control. Instead of worrying about the past or the future, we should appreciate things just as they are in the moment, in the now.“The only moment in which you can be truly alive is the present moment,” observes the Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh.In addition to living in the here and now, the Stoics recommend reflecting on the impermanence of the things around us.The Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius said that the things we love are like the leaves of a tree: They can fall at any moment with a gust of wind. He also said that changes in the world around us are not accidental but rather form part of the essence of the universe—a rather Buddhist notion, in fact.We should never forget that everything we have and all the people we love will disappear at some point. This is something we should keep in mind, but without giving in to pessimism. Being aware of the impermanence of things does not have to make us sad; it should help us love the present moment and those who surround us.“All things human are short-lived and perishable,” Seneca tells us.2The temporary, ephemeral, and impermanent nature of the world is central to every Buddhist discipline. Keeping this always in mind helps us avoid excessive pain in times of loss.Wabi-sabi is a Japanese concept that shows us the beauty of the fleeting, changeable, and imperfect nature of the world around us. Instead of searching for beauty in perfection, we should look for it in things that are flawed, incomplete.This is why the Japanese place such value, for example, on an irregular or cracked teacup. Only things that are imperfect, incomplete, and ephemeral can truly be beautiful, because only those things resemble the natural world.A complementary Japanese concept is that of ichi-go ichi-e, which could be translated as “This moment exists only now and won’t come again.” It is heard most often in social gatherings as a reminder that each encounter—whether with friends, family, or strangers—is unique and will never be repeated, meaning that we should enjoy the moment and not lose ourselves in worries about the past or the future.The concept is commonly used in tea ceremonies, Zen meditation, and Japanese martial arts, all of which place emphasis on being present in the moment.In the West, we’ve grown accustomed to the permanence of the stone buildings and cathedrals of Europe, which sometimes gives us the sense that nothing changes, making us forget about the passage of time. Greco-Roman architecture adores symmetry, sharp lines, imposing facades, and buildings and statues of the gods that outlast the centuries.Japanese architecture, on the other hand, doesn’t try to be imposing or perfect, because it is built in the spirit of wabi-sabi. The tradition of making structures out of wood presupposes their impermanence and the need for future generations to rebuild them. Japanese culture accepts the fleeting nature of the human being and everything we create.The Grand Shrine of Ise,3 for example, has been rebuilt every twenty years for centuries. The most important thing is not to keep the building standing for generations, but to preserve customs and traditions—things that can withstand the passage of time better than structures made by human hands.The key is to accept that there are certain things over which we have no control, like the passage of time and the ephemeral nature of the world around us.Ichi-go ichi-e teaches us to focus on the present and enjoy each moment that life brings us. This is why it is so important to find and pursue our ikigai.Wabi-sabi teaches us to appreciate the beauty of imperfection as an opportunity for growth.As the legend goes, the first time Hercules faced the Hydra, he despaired when he discovered that cutting off one of its heads meant that two would grow back in its place. He would never be able to kill the beast if it got stronger with every wound.As Nassim Nicholas Taleb explains in Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder,4 we use the word fragile to describe people, things, and organizations that are weakened when harmed, and the words robust and resilient for things that are able to withstand harm without weakening, but we don’t have a word for things that get stronger when harmed (up to a point).To refer to the kind of power possessed by the Hydra of Lerna, to talk about things that get stronger when they are harmed, Taleb proposes the term antifragile: “Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.”Catastrophes and exceptional circumstances offer good models for explaining antifragility. In 2011 a tsunami hit the Tōhoku region of Japan, doing tremendous damage to dozens of cities and towns along the coast, most famously Fukushima.When we visited the affected coast two years after the catastrophe, having driven for hours along cracked highways and past one empty gas station after another, we passed through several ghost towns whose streets had been taken over by the remnants of houses, piles of cars, and empty train stations. These towns were fragile spaces that had been forgotten by the government and could not recover on their own.Other places, such as Ishinomaki and Kesennuma, suffered extensive damage but were rebuilt within a few years, thanks to the efforts of many. Ishinomaki and Kesennuma showed how resilient they were in their ability to return to normal after the catastrophe.The earthquake that caused the tsunami also affected the Fukushima nuclear power plant. The Tokyo Electric Power Company engineers working at the plant were not prepared to recover from that kind of damage. The Fukushima nuclear facility is still in a state of emergency and will be for decades to come. It demonstrated its fragility in the face of an unprecedented catastrophe.The Japanese financial markets closed minutes after the earthquake. Which businesses did the best in the aftermath? Stock in big construction companies has been steadily on the rise since 2011; the need to rebuild the entire coast of Tōhoku is a boon for construction. In this case, Japanese construction companies are antifragile, since they benefited enormously from the catastrophe.Now let’s take a look at how we can apply this concept to our daily lives. How can we be more antifragile?Instead of having a single salary, try to find a way to make money from your hobbies, at other jobs, or by starting your own business. If you have only one salary, you might be left with nothing should your employer run into trouble, leaving you in a position of fragility. On the other hand, if you have several options and you lose your primary job, it might just happen that you end up dedicating more time to your secondary job, and maybe even make more money at it. You would have beaten that stroke of bad luck and would be, in that case, antifragile.One hundred percent of the seniors we interviewed in Ogimi had a primary and a secondary occupation. Most of them kept a vegetable garden as a secondary job, and sold their produce at the local market.The same idea goes for friendships and personal interests. It’s just a matter, as the saying goes, of not putting all your eggs in one basket.In the sphere of romantic relationships, there are those who focus all their energy on their partner and make him or her their whole world. Those people lose everything if the relationship doesn’t work out, whereas if they’ve cultivated strong friendships and a full life along the way, they’ll be in a better position to move on at the end of a relationship. They’ll be antifragile.Right now you might be thinking, “I don’t need more than one salary, and I’m happy with the friends I’ve always had. Why should I add anything new?” It might seem like a waste of time to add variation to our lives, because extraordinary things don’t ordinarily happen. We slip into a comfort zone. But the unexpected always happens, sooner or later.The world of finance turns out to be very useful in explaining this concept. If you have $10,000 saved up, you might put $9,000 of that into an index fund or fixed-term deposit, and invest the remaining $1,000 in ten start-ups with huge growth potential—say, $100 in each.One possible scenario is that three of the companies fail (you lose $300), the value of three other companies goes down (you lose another $100 or $200), the value of three goes up (you make $100 or $200), and the value of one of the start-ups increases twenty-fold (you make nearly $2,000, or maybe even more).You still make money, even if three of the businesses go completely belly-up. You’ve benefited from the damage, just like the Hydra.The key to becoming antifragile is taking on small risks that might lead to great reward, without exposing ourselves to dangers that might sink us, such as investing $10,000 in a fund of questionable reputation that we saw advertised in the newspaper.We’re taking the negative route for this exercise. Ask yourself: What makes me fragile? Certain people, things, and habits generate losses for us and make us vulnerable. Who and what are they?When we make our New Year’s resolutions, we tend to emphasize adding new challenges to our lives. It’s great to have this kind of objective, but setting “good riddance” goals can have an even bigger impact. For example:To build resilience into our lives, we shouldn’t fear adversity, because each setback is an opportunity for growth. If we adopt an antifragile attitude, we’ll find a way to get stronger with every blow, refining our lifestyle and staying focused on our ikigai.Taking a hit or two can be viewed as either a misfortune or an experience that we can apply to all areas of our lives, as we continually make corrections and set new and better goals. As Taleb writes in Antifragile, “We need randomness, mess, adventures, uncertainty, self-discovery, hear traumatic episodes, all these things that make life worth living.” We encourage those interested in the concept of antifragility to read Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s Antifragile.Life is pure imperfection, as the philosophy of wabi-sabi teaches us, and the passage of time shows us that everything is fleeting, but if you have a clear sense of your ikigai, each moment will hold so many possibilities that it will seem almost like an eternity.EPILOGUEMitsuo Aida was one of the most important calligraphers and haikuists of the twentieth century. He is yet another example of a Japanese person who dedicated his life to a very specific ikigai: communicating emotions with seventeen-syllable poems, using a shodo calligraphy brush.Many of Aida’s haikus philosophize about the importance of the present moment, and the passage of time. The poem reproduced below could be translated as “In the here and now, the only thing in my life is your life.”いまここにしかないわたしのいのちあなたのいのちIn another poem, Aida writes simply, “Here, now.” It is an artwork that seeks to evoke feelings of mono no aware (a melancholy appreciation of the ephemeral).いまここThe following poem touches on one of the secrets of bringing ikigai into our lives: “Happiness is always determined by your heart.”しあわせはいつも自分の心がきめるThis last one, also by Aida, means “Keep going; don’t change your path.”そのままでいいがなOnce you discover your ikigai, pursuing it and nurturing it every day will bring meaning to your life. The moment your life has this purpose, you will achieve a happy state of flow in all you do, like the calligrapher at his canvas or the chef who, after half a century, still prepares sushi for his patrons with love.Our ikigai is different for all of us, but one thing we have in common is that we are all searching for meaning. When we spend our days feeling connected to what is meaningful to us, we live more fully; when we lose the connection, we feel despair.Modern life estranges us more and more from our true nature, making it very easy for us to lead lives lacking in meaning. Powerful forces and incentives (money, power, attention, success) distract us on a daily basis; don’t let them take over your life.Our intuition and curiosity are very powerful internal compasses to help us connect with our ikigai. Follow those things you enjoy, and get away from or change those you dislike. Be led by your curiosity, and keep busy by doing things that fill you with meaning and happiness. It doesn’t need to be a big thing: we might find meaning in being good parents or in helping our neighbors.There is no perfect strategy to connecting with our ikigai. But what we learned from the Okinawans is that we should not worry too much about finding it.Life is not a problem to be solved. Just remember to have something that keeps you busy doing what you love while being surrounded by the people who love you.We’ll conclude this journey with ten rules we’ve distilled from the wisdom of the long-living residents of Ogimi:The authors of this book wish you a long, happy, and purposeful life.Thank you for joining us,HÉCTOR GARCÍA AND FRANCESC MIRALLESChapter I.

But what would happen if we had the technology to add a year of life expectancy every year? In theory, we would achieve biological immortality, having reached aging’s “escape velocity.”Imagine a sign far off in the future with a number on it that represents the age of your death. Every year that you live, you advance closer to the sign. When you reach the sign, you die.Now imagine a rabbit holding the sign and walking to the future. Every year that you live, the rabbit is half a year as far away. After a while, you will reach the rabbit and die.But what if the rabbit could walk at a pace of one year for every year of your life? You would never be able to catch the rabbit, and therefore you would never die.The speed at which the rabbit walks to the future is our technology. The more we advance technology and knowledge of our bodies, the faster we can make the rabbit walk.Aging’s escape velocity is the moment at which the rabbit walks at a pace of one year per year or faster, and we become immortal.Researchers with an eye to the future, such as Ray Kurzweil and Aubrey de Grey, claim that we’ll reach this escape velocity in a matter of decades. Other scientists are less optimistic, predicting that we’ll reach a limit, a maximum age we won’t be able to surpass, no matter how much technology we have. For example, some biologists assert that our cells stop regenerating after about 120 years.There is much wisdom in the classic saying “mens sana in corpore sano” (“a sound mind in a sound body”): It reminds us that both mind and body are important, and that the health of one is connected to that of the other. It has been shown that maintaining an active, adaptable mind is one of the key factors in staying young.Having a youthful mind also drives you toward a healthy lifestyle that will slow the aging process.Just as a lack of physical exercise has negative effects on our bodies and mood, a lack of mental exercise is bad for us because it causes our neurons and neural connections to deteriorate—and, as a result, reduces our ability to react to our surroundings.This is why it’s so important to give your brain a workout.One pioneer in advocating for mental exercise is the Israeli neuroscientist Shlomo Breznitz, who argues that the brain needs a lot of stimulation in order to stay in shape. As he stated in an interview with Eduard Punset for the Spanish television program Redes:There is a tension between what is good for someone and what they want to do. This is because people, especially older people, like to do things as they’ve always done them. The problem is that when the brain develops ingrained habits, it doesn’t need to think anymore. Things get done quickly and efficiently on automatic pilot, often in a very advantageous way. This creates a tendency to stick to routines, and the only way of breaking these is to confront the brain with new information.1Presented with new information, the brain creates new connections and is revitalized. This is why it is so important to expose yourself to change, even if stepping outside your comfort zone means feeling a bit of anxiety.The effects of mental training have been scientifically demonstrated. According to Collins Hemingway and Shlomo Breznitz in their book Maximum Brainpower: Challenging the Brain for Health and Wisdom, mental training is beneficial on many levels: “You begin exercising your brain by doing a certain task for the first time,” he writes. “And at first it seems very difficult, but as you learn how to do it, the training is already working. The second time, you realize that it’s easier, not harder, to do, because you’re getting better at it. This has a fantastic effect on a person’s mood. In and of itself, it is a transformation that affects not only the results obtained, but also his or her self-image.”This description of a “mental workout” might sound a bit formal, but simply interacting with others—playing a game, for example—offers new stimuli and helps prevent the depression that can come with solitude.Our neurons start to age while we are still in our twenties. This process is slowed, however, by intellectual activity, curiosity, and a desire to learn. Dealing with new situations, learning something new every day, playing games, and interacting with other people seem to be essential antiaging strategies for the mind. Furthermore, a more positive outlook in this regard will yield greater mental benefits.Many people seem older than they are. Research into the causes of premature aging has shown that stress has a lot to do with it, because the body wears down much faster during periods of crisis. The American Institute of Stress investigated this degenerative process and concluded that most health problems are caused by stress.Researchers at the Heidelberg University Hospital conducted a study in which they subjected a young doctor to a job interview, which they made even more stressful by forcing him to solve complex math problems for thirty minutes. Afterward, they took a blood sample. What they discovered was that his antibodies had reacted to stress the same way they react to pathogens, activating the proteins that trigger an immune response. The problem is that this response not only neutralizes harmful agents, it also damages healthy cells, leading them to age prematurely.The University of California conducted a similar study, taking data and samples from thirty-nine women who had high levels of stress due to the illness of one of their children and comparing them to samples from women with healthy children and low levels of stress. They found that stress promotes cellular aging by weakening cell structures known as telomeres, which affect cellular regeneration and how our cells age. As the study revealed, the greater the stress, the greater the degenerative effect on cells.These days, people live at a frantic pace and in a nearly constant state of competition. At this fever pitch, stress is a natural response to the information being received by the body as potentially dangerous or problematic.Theoretically, this is a useful reaction, as it helps us survive in hostile surroundings. Over the course of our evolution, we have used this response to deal with difficult situations and to flee from predators.The alarm that goes off in our head makes our neurons activate the pituitary gland, which produces hormones that release corticotropin, which in turn circulates through the body via the sympathetic nervous system. The adrenal gland is then triggered to release adrenaline and cortisol. Adrenaline raises our respiratory rate and pulse and prepares our muscles for action, getting the body ready to react to perceived danger, while cortisol increases the release of dopamine and blood glucose, which is what gets us “charged up” and allows us to face challenges.Cave DwellersModern HumansWere relaxed most of the time.Work most of the time and are alert to any and all threats.Felt stress only in very specific situations.Are online or waiting for notifications from their cell phones twenty-four hours a day.The threats were real: A predator could end their lives at any moment.The brain associates the ping of a cell phone or an e-mail notification with the threat of a predator.High doses of cortisol and adrenaline at moments of danger kept the body healthy.Low doses of cortisol flow constantly through the body, with implications for a range of health problems, including adrenal fatigue and chronic fatigue syndrome.These processes are, in moderation, beneficial—they help us overcome challenges in our daily lives. Nonetheless, the stress to which human beings are subjected today is clearly harmful.Stress has a degenerative effect over time. A sustained state of emergency affects the neurons associated with memory, as well as inhibiting the release of certain hormones, the absence of which can cause depression. Its secondary effects include irritability, insomnia, anxiety, and high blood pressure.As such, though challenges are good for keeping mind and body active, we should adjust our high-stress lifestyles in order to avoid the premature aging of our bodies.Whether or not the threats we perceive are real, stress is an easily identifiable condition that not only causes anxiety but is also highly psychosomatic, affecting everything from our digestive system to our skin.This is why prevention is so important in avoiding the toll that stress takes on us—and why many experts recommend practicing mindfulness.The central premise of this stress-reduction method is focusing on the self: noticing our responses, even if they are conditioned by habit, in order to be fully conscious of them. In this way, we connect with the here and now and limit thoughts that tend to spiral out of control.“We have to learn to turn off the autopilot that’s steering us in an endless loop. We all know people who snack while talking on the phone or watching the news. You ask them if the omelet they just ate had onion in it, and they can’t tell you,” says Roberto Alcibar, who abandoned his fast-paced life to become a certified instructor of mindfulness after an illness threw him into a period of acute stress.One way to reach a state of mindfulness is through meditation, which helps filter the information that reaches us from the outside world. It can also be achieved through breathing exercises, yoga, and body scans.Achieving mindfulness involves a gradual process of training, but with a bit of practice we can learn to focus our mind completely, which reduces stress and helps us live longer.While sustained, intense stress is a known enemy of longevity and both mental and physical health, low levels of stress have been shown to be beneficial.After observing a group of test subjects for more than twenty years, Dr. Howard S. Friedman, a psychology professor at the University of California, Riverside, discovered that people who maintained a low level of stress, who faced challenges and put their heart and soul into their work in order to succeed, lived longer than those who chose a more relaxed lifestyle and retired earlier. From this, he concluded that a small dose of stress is a positive thing, as those who live with low levels of stress tend to develop healthier habits, smoke less, and drink less alcohol.2Given this, it is not surprising that many of the supercentenarians—people who live to be 110 or more—whom we’ll meet in this book talk about having lived intense lives and working well into old age.In the Western world in particular, the rise in sedentary behavior has led to numerous diseases such as hypertension and obesity, which in turn affect longevity.Spending too much time seated at work or at home not only reduces muscular and respiratory fitness but also increases appetite and curbs the desire to participate in activities. Being sedentary can lead to hypertension, imbalanced eating, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and even certain kinds of cancer. Recent studies have shown a connection between a lack of physical activity and the progressive distortion of telomeres in the immune system, which ages those cells and, in turn, the organism as a whole.This is a problem at all life stages, not only among adults. Sedentary children suffer from high rates of obesity and all its associated health issues and risks, which is why it’s so important to develop a healthy and active lifestyle at an early age.It’s easy to be less sedentary; it just takes a bit of effort and a few changes to your routine. We can access a more active lifestyle that makes us feel better inside and out—we just have to add a few ingredients to our everyday habits:By making these small changes, we can begin to renew our bodies and minds and increase our life expectancy.Though we age both externally and internally, both physically and mentally, one of the things that tell us the most about people’s age is their skin, which takes on different textures and colors according to processes going on beneath the surface. Most of those who make their living as models claim to sleep between nine and ten hours the night before a fashion show. This gives their skin a taut, wrinkle-free appearance and a healthy, radiant glow.Science has shown that sleep is a key antiaging tool, because when we sleep we generate melatonin, a hormone that occurs naturally in our bodies. The pineal gland produces it from the neurotransmitter serotonin according to our diurnal and nocturnal rhythms, and it plays a role in our sleep and waking cycles.A powerful antioxidant, melatonin helps us live longer, and also offers the following benefits:For all these reasons, melatonin is a great ally in preserving youth. It should be noted, however, that melatonin production decreases after age thirty. We can compensate for this by:Experts are trying to determine whether artificially stimulating production of melatonin might help slow the aging process . . . which would confirm the theory that we already carry the secret to longevity within us.The mind has tremendous power over the body and how quickly it ages. Most doctors agree that the secret to keeping the body young is keeping the mind active—a key element of ikigai—and in not caving in when we face difficulties throughout our lives.One study, conducted at Yeshiva University, found that the people who live the longest have two dispositional traits in common: a positive attitude and a high degree of emotional awareness. In other words, those who face challenges with a positive outlook and are able to manage their emotions are already well on their way toward longevity.A stoic attitude—serenity in the face of a setback—can also help keep you young, as it lowers anxiety and stress levels and stabilizes behavior. This can be seen in the greater life expectancies of certain cultures with unhurried, deliberate lifestyles.Many centenarians and supercentenarians have similar profiles: They have had full lives that were difficult at times, but they knew how to approach these challenges with a positive attitude and not be overwhelmed by the obstacles they faced.Alexander Imich, who in 2014 became the world’s oldest living man at age 111, knew he had good genes but understood that other factors contributed, too: “The life you live is equally or more important for longevity,” he said in an interview with Reuters after being added to Guinness World Records in 2014.During our stay in Ogimi, the village that holds the Guinness record for longevity, a woman who was about to turn 100 years old sang the following song for us in a mixture of Japanese and the local dialect:To keep healthy and have a long life,eat just a little of everything with relish,go to bed early, get up early, and then go out for a walk.We live each day with serenity and we enjoy the journey.To keep healthy and have a long life,we get on well with all of our friends.Spring, summer, fall, winter,we happily enjoy all the seasons.The secret is to not get distracted by how old the fingers are;from the fingers to the head and back once again.If you keep moving with your fingers working, 100 yearswill come to you.*We can now use our fingers to turn the page to the next chapter, where we will look at the close relationship between longevity and discovering our life’s mission.Discover your next great read!Get personalized book picks and up-to-date news about this author.Sign up now.Héctor García is a citizen of Japan, where he has lived for over a decade, and of Spain, where he was born.

Then mutual acquaintance put us touch , launching friendship led project seems destined last lifetime.The next time got together , year later , strolled park downtown Tokyo ended talking trends Western psychology , specifically logotherapy , helps people find purpose life.We remarked Viktor Frankl ’ logotherapy gone fashion among practicing therapists , favored schools psychology , though people still search meaning live . We ask things like : What meaning life ? Is point live longer , I seek higher purpose ? Why people know want passion life , others languish confusion ? At point conversation , mysterious word ikigai came up.This Japanese concept , translates roughly “ happiness always busy , ” like logotherapy , goes step beyond . It also seems one way explaining extraordinary longevity Japanese , especially island Okinawa , 24.55 people age 100 every 100,000 inhabitants—far global average.Those study inhabitants island south Japan live longer people anywhere else world believe one keys—in addition healthful diet , simple life outdoors , green tea , subtropical climate ( average temperature like Hawaii ) —is ikigai shapes lives.While researching concept , discovered single book fields psychology personal development dedicated bringing philosophy West.Is ikigai reason centenarians Okinawa anywhere else ? How inspire people stay active end ? What secret long happy life ? As explored matter , discovered one place particular , Ogimi , rural town north end island population three thousand , boasts highest life expectancy world—a fact earned nickname Village Longevity.Okinawa Japan ’ shikuwasa—a limelike fruit packs extraordinary antioxidant punch—comes . Could Ogimi ’ secret long life ? Or purity water used brew Moringa tea ? We decided go study secrets Japanese centenarians person . After year preliminary research arrived village—where residents speak ancient dialect practice animist religion features long-haired forest sprites called bunagaya—with cameras recording devices hand . As soon arrived could sense incredible friendliness residents , laughed joked incessantly amid lush green hills fed crystalline waters.As conducted interviews eldest residents town , realized something far powerful natural resources work : uncommon joy flows inhabitants guides long pleasurable journey lives.Again , mysterious ikigai.But , exactly ? How get ? It never ceased surprise us nearly eternal life located precisely Okinawa , two hundred thousand innocent lives lost end World War II . Rather harbor animosity toward outsiders , however , Okinawans live principle ichariba chode , local expression means “ treat everyone like brother , even ’ never met . ” It turns one secrets happiness Ogimi ’ residents feeling like part community . From early age practice yuimaaru , teamwork , used helping one another.Nurturing friendships , eating light , getting enough rest , regular , moderate exercise part equation good health , heart joie de vivre inspires centenarians keep celebrating birthdays cherishing new day ikigai.The purpose book bring secrets Japan ’ centenarians give tools find ikigai.Because discover ikigai everything need long joyful journey life.Happy travels ! HÉCTOR GARCÍA AND FRANCESC MIRALLESWhat reason ? According Japanese , everyone ikigai—what French philosopher might call raison ’ être . Some people found ikigai , others still looking , though carry within them.Our ikigai hidden deep inside us , finding requires patient search . According born Okinawa , island centenarians world , ikigai reason get morning.Having clearly defined ikigai brings satisfaction , happiness , meaning lives . The purpose book help find , share insights Japanese philosophy lasting health body , mind , spirit.One surprising thing notice , living Japan , active people remain retire . In fact , many Japanese people never really retire—they keep love long health allows.There , fact , word Japanese means retire sense “ leaving workforce good ” English . According Dan Buettner , National Geographic reporter knows country well , purpose life important Japanese culture idea retirement simply ’ exist there.Certain longevity studies suggest strong sense community clearly defined ikigai important famously healthful Japanese diet—perhaps even . Recent medical studies centenarians Okinawa so-called Blue Zones—the geographic regions people live longest—provide number interesting facts extraordinary human beings : In Japanese , ikigai written 生き甲斐 , combining 生き , means “ life , ” 甲斐 , means “ worthwhile . ” 甲斐 broken characters 甲 , means “ armor , ” “ number one , ” “ first ” ( head battle , taking initiative leader ) , 斐 , means “ beautiful ” “ elegant . ” Though consider findings course book , research clearly indicates Okinawans ’ focus ikigai gives sense purpose every day plays important role health longevity.Okinawa holds first place among world ’ Blue Zones . In Okinawa , women particular live longer fewer diseases anywhere else world . The five regions identified analyzed Dan Buettner book The Blue Zones : In following chapters , examine several factors seem keys longevity found across Blue Zones , paying special attention Okinawa so-called Village Longevity . First , however , worth pointing three regions islands , resources scarce communities help one another.For many , helping others might ikigai strong enough keep alive.According scientists studied five Blue Zones , keys longevity diet , exercise , finding purpose life ( ikigai ) , forming strong social ties—that , broad circle friends good family relations.Members communities manage time well order reduce stress , consume little meat processed foods , drink alcohol moderation.1They ’ strenuous exercise , move every day , taking walks working vegetable gardens . People Blue Zones would rather walk drive . Gardening , involves daily low-intensity movement , practice almost common.One common sayings Japan “ Hara hachi bu , ” repeated eating means something like “ Fill belly 80 percent . ” Ancient wisdom advises eating full . This Okinawans stop eating feel stomachs reach 80 percent capacity , rather overeating wearing bodies long digestive processes accelerate cellular oxidation.Of course , way know objectively stomach 80 percent capacity . The lesson learn saying stop eating starting feel full . The extra side dish , snack eat know hearts ’ really need , apple pie lunch—all give us pleasure short term , make us happier long term.The way food served also important . By presenting meals many small plates , Japanese tend eat less . A typical meal restaurant Japan served five plates tray , four small main dish slightly bigger . Having five plates front makes seem like going eat lot , happens time end feeling slightly hungry . This one reasons Westerners Japan typically lose weight stay trim.Recent studies nutritionists reveal Okinawans consume daily average 1,800 1,900 calories , compared 2,200 3,300 United States , body mass index 18 22 , compared 26 27 United States.The Okinawan diet rich tofu , sweet potatoes , fish ( three times per week ) , vegetables ( roughly 11 ounces per day ) . In chapter dedicated nutrition see healthy , antioxidant-rich foods included 80 percent.It customary Okinawa form close bonds within local communities . A moai informal group people common interests look one another . For many , serving community becomes part ikigai.The moai origins hard times , farmers would get together share best practices help one another cope meager harvests.Members moai make set monthly contribution group . This payment allows participate meetings , dinners , games go shogi ( Japanese chess ) , whatever hobby common.The funds collected group used activities , money left , one member ( decided rotating basis ) receives set amount surplus . In way , part moai helps maintain emotional financial stability . If member moai financial trouble , get advance group ’ savings . While details moai ’ accounting practices vary according group economic means , feeling belonging support gives individual sense security helps increase life expectancy.• • •FOLLOWING THIS BRIEF introduction topics covered book , look causes premature aging modern life , explore different factors related ikigai.What logotherapy ? A colleague asked Viktor Frankl define school psychology single phrase , Frankl replied , “ Well , logotherapy patient sits straight listen things , occasion , hard hear . ” The colleague described psychoanalysis following terms : “ In psychoanalysis , patient lies couch tells things , occasion , hard say . ” Frankl explains one first questions would ask patients “ Why commit suicide ? ” Usually patient found good reasons , able carry . What , , logotherapy ? 1The answer pretty clear : It helps find reasons live.Logotherapy pushes patients consciously discover life ’ purpose order confront neuroses . Their quest fulfill destiny motivates press forward , breaking mental chains past overcoming whatever obstacles encounter along way.A study conducted Frankl Vienna clinic found among patients personnel , around 80 percent believed human beings needed reason living , around 60 percent felt someone something lives worth dying for.2The search purpose became personal , driving force allowed Frankl achieve goals . The process logotherapy summarized five steps : Frankl would live die principles ideals . His experiences prisoner Auschwitz showed “ Everything taken man one thing : last human freedoms—to choose one ’ attitude given set circumstances , choose one ’ way . ” 3 It something go alone , without help , inspired rest life.Ten Differences Between Psychoanalysis LogotherapyPsychoanalysisLogotherapyThe patient reclines couch , like patient.The patient sits facing therapist , guides without passing judgment.Is retrospective : It looks past.Looks toward future.Is introspective : It analyzes neuroses.Does delve patient ’ neuroses.The drive toward pleasure.The drive toward purpose meaning.Centers psychology.Includes spiritual dimension.Works psychogenic neuroses.Also works noogenic , existential , neuroses.Analyzes unconscious origin conflicts ( instinctual dimension ) .Deals conflicts arise ( spiritual dimension ) .Limits patient ’ instincts.Also deals spiritual realities.Is fundamentally incompatible faith.Is compatible faith.Seeks reconcile conflicts satisfy impulses instincts.Seeks help patient find meaning life satisfy moral principles.Existential frustration arises life without purpose , purpose skewed . In Frankl ’ view , however , need see frustration anomaly symptom neurosis ; instead , positive thing—a catalyst change.Logotherapy see frustration mental illness , way forms therapy , rather spiritual anguish—a natural beneficial phenomenon drives suffer seek cure , whether help others , find greater satisfaction life . It helps change destiny.Logotherapy enters picture person needs help , needs guidance discovering life ’ purpose later overcoming conflicts keep moving toward objective . In Man ’ Search Meaning , Frankl cites one Nietzsche ’ famous aphorisms : “ He live bear almost . ” Based experience , Frankl believed health depends natural tension comes comparing ’ accomplished far ’ like achieve future . What need , , peaceful existence , challenge strive meet applying skills disposal.Existential crisis , hand , typical modern societies people told , others , rather want . They often try fill gap expected want economic power physical pleasure , numbing senses . It even lead suicide.Sunday neurosis , example , happens , without obligations commitments workweek , individual realizes empty inside . He find solution . Above , find purpose , reason getting bed—his ikigai.In study conducted Vienna Polyclinic Hospital , Frankl ’ team found 55 percent patients interviewed experiencing degree existential crisis.4According logotherapy , discovering one ’ purpose life helps individual fill existential void . Frankl , man faced problems turned objectives actions , could look back life peace grew old . He envy still enjoying youth , amassed broad set experiences showed lived something.In pages follow , look four cases Frankl ’ practice order better understand search meaning purpose.In German concentration camps , would later built Japan Korea , psychiatrists confirmed prisoners greatest chance survival things wanted accomplish outside camp , felt strong need get alive . This true Frankl , , released successfully developing school logotherapy , realized first patient practice.Frankl goal achieve , made persevere . He arrived Auschwitz carrying manuscript contained theories research compiled course career , ready publication . When confiscated , felt compelled write , need drove gave life meaning amid constant horror doubt concentration camp—so much years , especially fell ill typhus , would jot fragments key words lost work scrap paper found.An important North American diplomat went Frankl pick left course treatment started five years earlier United States . When Frankl asked ’ started therapy first place , diplomat answered hated job country ’ international policies , follow enforce . His American psychoanalyst , ’ seeing years , insisted make peace father government job , representations paternal figure , would seem less disagreeable . Frankl , however , showed sessions frustration due fact wanted pursue different career , diplomat concluded treatment idea mind.Five years later , former diplomat informed Frankl working time different profession , happy.In Frankl ’ view , man ’ need years psychoanalysis , also ’ even really considered “ patient ” need therapy . He simply someone search new life ’ purpose ; soon found , life took deeper meaning.The mother boy died age eleven admitted Frankl ’ clinic tried kill son . It son , paralyzed since birth , kept carrying plan : He believe life purpose , mother killed , would keep achieving goals.The woman shared story group session . To help , Frankl asked another woman imagine hypothetical situation lay deathbed , old wealthy childless . The woman insisted , case , would felt life failure.When suicidal mother asked perform exercise , imagining deathbed , looked back realized done everything power children—for . She given paralyzed son good life , turned kind , reasonably happy person . To added , crying , “ As , I look back peacefully life ; I say life full meaning , I tried hard live fully ; I done best—I done best son . My life failure ! ” In way , imagining deathbed looking back , suicidal mother found meaning , though aware , life already had.An elderly doctor , unable overcome deep depression ’ fallen death wife two years earlier , went Frankl help.Instead giving advice analyzing condition , Frankl asked would happened one died first . The doctor , horrified , answered would terrible poor wife , would suffered tremendously . To Frankl responded , “ You see , doctor ? You spared suffering , price pay survive , mourn . ” The doctor ’ say another word . He left Frankl ’ office peace , taking therapist ’ hand . He able tolerate pain place beloved wife . His life given purpose.In decade logotherapy came being—a years earlier , fact—Shoma Morita created purpose-centered therapy , Japan . It proved effective treatment neurosis , obsessive-compulsive disorder , posttraumatic stress.In addition psychotherapist , Shoma Morita Zen Buddhist , therapy left lasting spiritual mark Japan.Many Western forms therapy focus controlling modifying patient ’ emotions . In West , tend believe think influences feel , turn influences act . In contrast , Morita therapy focuses teaching patients accept emotions without trying control , since feelings change result actions.In addition accepting patient ’ emotions , Morita therapy seeks “ create ” new emotions basis actions . According Morita , emotions learned experience repetition.Morita therapy meant eliminate symptoms ; instead teaches us accept desires , anxieties , fears , worries , let go . As Morita writes book Morita Therapy True Nature Anxiety-Based Disorders , “ In feelings , best wealthy generous . ” Morita explained idea letting go negative feelings following fable : A donkey tied post rope keep walking around post attempt free , become immobilized attached post . The thing applies people obsessive thinking become trapped suffering try escape fears discomfort.5Morita ’ original treatment , lasts fifteen twenty-one days , consists following stages : Morita great Zen master Naikan introspective meditation . Much therapy draws knowledge mastery school , centers three questions individual must ask him- : Through reflections , stop identifying others cause problems deepen sense responsibility . As Morita said , “ If angry want fight , think three days coming blows . After three days , intense desire fight pass . ” 7Logotherapy Morita therapy grounded personal , unique experience access without therapists spiritual retreats : mission finding ikigai , existential fuel . Once find , matter courage making effort stay right path.In following chapters , ’ take look basic tools ’ need get moving along path : finding flow tasks ’ chosen , eating balanced mindful way , low-intensity exercise , learning give difficulties arise . In order , accept world—like people live it—is imperfect , still full opportunities growth achievement.Are ready throw passion important thing world ? We repeatedly do.Excellence , , act habit.—AristotleImagine skiing one favorite slopes . Powdery snow flies sides like white sand . Conditions perfect.You entirely focused skiing well . You know exactly move moment . There future , past . There present . You feel snow , skis , body , consciousness united single entity . You completely immersed experience , thinking distracted anything else . Your ego dissolves , become part doing.This kind experience Bruce Lee described famous “ Be water , friend . ” We ’ felt sense time vanish lose activity enjoy . We start cooking know , several hours passed . We spend afternoon book forget world going notice sunset realize ’ eaten dinner . We go surfing ’ realize many hours spent water next day , muscles ache.The opposite also happen . When complete task ’ want , every minute feels like lifetime ’ stop looking watch . As quip attributed Einstein goes , “ Put hand hot stove minute seems like hour . Sit pretty girl hour , seems like minute . That relativity . ” The funny thing someone else might really enjoy task , want finish quickly possible.What makes us enjoy something much forget whatever worries might ? When happiest ? These questions help us discover ikigai.These questions also heart psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi ’ research experience completely immersed . Csikszentmihalyi called state “ flow , ” described pleasure , delight , creativity , process completely immersed life.There magic recipe finding happiness , living according ikigai , one key ingredient ability reach state flow , state , “ optimal experience . ” In order achieve optimal experience , focus increasing time spend activities bring us state flow , rather allowing get caught activities offer immediate pleasure—like eating much , abusing drugs alcohol , stuffing chocolate front TV.As Csikszentmihalyi asserts book Flow : The Psychology Optimal Experience , flow “ state people involved activity nothing else seems matter ; experience enjoyable people even great cost , sheer sake . ” It creative professionals require high doses concentration promote flow . Most athletes , chess players , engineers also spend much time activities bring state.According Csikszentmihalyi ’ research , chess player feels way upon entering state flow mathematician working formula surgeon performing operation . A professor psychology , Csikszentmihalyi analyzed data people around world discovered flow among individuals ages cultures . In New York Okinawa , reach state flow way.But happens mind state ? When flow , focused concrete task without distractions . Our mind “ order . ” The opposite occurs try something mind things.If often find losing focus working something consider important , several strategies employ increase chances achieving flow.According researcher Owen Schaffer DePaul University , requirements achieving flow : Schaffer ’ model encourages us take tasks chance completing slightly outside comfort zone.Every task , sport , job set rules , need set skills follow . If rules completing task achieving purpose basic relative skill set , likely get bored . Activities easy lead apathy.If , hand , assign task difficult , ’ skills complete almost certainly give up—and feel frustrated , boot.The ideal find middle path , something aligned abilities bit stretch , experience challenge . This Ernest Hemingway meant said , “ Sometimes I write better I . ” 2We want see challenges end enjoy feeling pushing . Bertrand Russell expressed similar idea said , “ To able concentrate considerable amount time essential difficult achievement . ” 3If ’ graphic designer , learn new software program next project . If ’ programmer , use new programming language . If ’ dancer , try incorporate next routine movement seemed impossible years.Add little something extra , something takes comfort zone.Even something simple reading means following certain rules , certain abilities knowledge . If set read book quantum mechanics specialists physics without specialists physics , ’ probably give minutes . On end spectrum , already know everything book tell us , ’ get bored right away.However , book appropriate knowledge abilities , builds already know , ’ immerse reading , time flow . This pleasure satisfaction evidence tune ikigai.EasyChallengingBeyond Our AbilitiesBoredomFlowAnxietyVideo games—played moderation—board games , sports great ways achieve flow , objective tends clear : Beat rival record following set explicitly defined rules.Unfortunately , objective ’ quite clear situations.According study Boston Consulting Group , asked bosses , number one complaint employees multinational corporations ’ “ communicate team ’ mission clearly , ” , result , employees ’ know objectives are.What often happens , especially big companies , executives get lost details obsessive planning , creating strategies hide fact ’ clear objective . It ’ like heading sea map destination.It much important compass pointing concrete objective map . Joi Ito , director MIT Media Lab , encourages us use principle “ compass maps ” tool navigate world uncertainty . In book Whiplash : How Survive Our Faster Future , Jeff Howe write , “ In increasingly unpredictable world moving ever quickly , detailed map may lead deep woods unnecessarily high cost . A good compass , though , always take need go . It ’ mean start journey without idea ’ going . What mean understanding path goal may straight , ’ finish faster efficiently would trudged along preplanned route . ” In business , creative professions , education alike , ’ important reflect hope achieve starting work , study , make something . We ask questions : Having clear objective important achieving flow , also know leave behind get business . Once journey begun , keep objective mind without obsessing it.When Olympic athletes compete gold medal , ’ stop think pretty medal . They present moment—they flow . If lose focus second , thinking proud ’ show medal parents , ’ almost certainly commit error critical moment win competition.One common example writer ’ block . Imagine writer finish novel three months . The objective clear ; problem writer ’ stop obsessing . Every day wakes thinking , “ I write novel , ” every day sets reading newspaper cleaning house . Every evening feels frustrated promises ’ get work next day.Days , weeks , months pass , writer still ’ gotten anything page , would taken sit get first word , second . . . flow project , expressing ikigai.As soon take first small steps , anxiety disappear achieve pleasant flow activity ’ . Getting back Albert Einstein , “ happy man satisfied present dwell future . ” 4Vague ObjectiveClearly Defined Objective Focus ProcessObsessive Desire Achieve Goal While Ignoring ProcessConfusion ; time energy wasted meaningless tasksFlowFixation objective rather getting businessMental blockFlowMental blockThis perhaps one greatest obstacles face today , much technology many distractions . We ’ listening video YouTube writing e-mail , suddenly chat prompt pops answer . Then smartphone vibrates pocket ; soon respond message , ’ back computer , logging Facebook.Pretty soon thirty minutes passed , ’ forgotten e-mail writing supposed about.This also happens sometimes put movie dinner ’ realize delicious salmon ’ taking last bite.We often think combining tasks save us time , scientific evidence shows opposite effect . Even claim good multitasking productive . In fact , least productive people.Our brains take millions bits information actually process dozen per second . When say ’ multitasking , ’ really switching back forth tasks quickly . Unfortunately , ’ computers adept parallel processing . We end spending energy alternating tasks , instead focusing one well.Concentrating one thing time may single important factor achieving flow.According Csikszentmihalyi , order focus task need : Technology great , ’ control . It ’ great takes control us . For example , write research paper , might sit computer use Google look information need . However , ’ disciplined , might end surfing Web instead writing paper . In case , Google Internet taken , pulling state flow.It scientifically shown continually ask brains switch back forth tasks , waste time , make mistakes , remember less ’ done.Several studies conducted Stanford University Clifford Ivar Nass describe generation suffering epidemic multitasking . One study analyzed behavior hundreds students , dividing groups based number things tended . The students addicted multitasking typically alternated among four tasks ; example , taking notes reading textbook , listening podcast , answering messages smartphone , sometimes checking Twitter timeline.Each group students shown screen several red several blue arrows . The objective exercise count red arrows.At first , students answered correctly right away , without much trouble . As number blue arrows increased ( number red arrows stayed ; position changed ) , however , students accustomed multitasking serious trouble counting red arrows time allotted , quickly students habitually multitask , one simple reason : They got distracted blue arrows ! Their brains trained pay attention every stimulus , regardless importance , brains students trained focus single task—in case , counting red arrows ignoring blue ones.5Other studies indicate working several things lowers productivity least 60 percent IQ ten points.One study funded Swedish Council Working Life Social Research found sample group four thousand young adults ages twenty twenty-four addicted smartphones got less sleep , felt less connected community school , likely show signs depression.6Concentrating Single TaskMultitaskingMakes achieving flow likelyMakes achieving flow impossibleIncreases productivityDecreases productivity 60 percent ( though ’ seem ) Increases power retentionMakes harder remember thingsMakes us less likely make mistakesMakes us likely make mistakesHelps us feel calm control task handMakes us feel stressed sensation ’ losing control , tasks controlling usCauses us become considerate pay full attention around usCauses us hurt around us “ addiction ” stimuli : always checking phones , always social media . . .Increases creativityReduces creativityWhat avoid falling victim flow-impeding epidemic ? How train brains focus single task ? Here ideas creating space time free distractions , increase chances reaching state flow thereby getting touch ikigai : Advantages FlowDisadvantages DistractionA focused mindA wandering mindLiving presentThinking past futureWe free worryConcerns daily life people around us invade thoughtsThe hours fly byEvery minute seems endlessWe feel controlWe lose control fail complete task hand , tasks people keep us workWe prepare thoroughlyWe act without preparedWe know given momentWe frequently get stuck ’ know proceedOur mind clear overcomes obstacles flow thoughtWe plagued doubts , concerns , low self-esteemIt ’ pleasantIt ’ boring exhaustingOur ego fades : We ones controlling activity task ’ doing—the task leading usConstant self-criticism : Our ego present feel frustratedWhat takumis ( artisans ) , engineers , inventors , otakus ( fans anime manga ) common ? They understand importance flowing ikigai times.One widespread stereotype people Japan ’ exceptionally dedicated hardworking , even though Japanese people say look like ’ working harder really . There doubt , though , ability completely absorbed task , perseverance problem solved . One first words one learns starting Japanese lessons ganbaru , means “ persevere ” “ stay firm one ’ best . ” Japanese people often apply even basic tasks intensity borders obsession . We see kinds contexts , “ retirees ” taking meticulous care rice fields mountains Nagano college students working weekend shift convenience stores known konbinis . If go Japan , ’ experience attention detail firsthand almost every transaction.Walk one stores sell handcrafted objects Naha , Kanazawa , Kyoto ’ also discover Japan treasure trove traditional craftwork . The people Japan unique talent creating new technologies preserving artisanal traditions techniques.Toyota employs “ artisans ” able make certain type screw hand . These takumi , experts particular manual skill , extremely important Toyota , hard replace . Some people know perform exact skill , ’ seem though new generation going take mantle.Turntable needles another example : They ’ produced almost exclusively Japan , find last remaining people know use machinery required make precision needles , trying pass knowledge descendants.We met takumi visit Kumano , small town near Hiroshima . We day , working photo essay one famous brands makeup brushes West . The billboard welcoming visitors Kumano shows mascot holding large brush . In addition brush factories , town full little houses vegetable gardens ; heading farther , see several Shinto shrines base mountains surround town.We spent hours taking photos factories full people orderly rows , single task—such painting handles brushes loading boxes onto trucks—before realized still ’ seen anyone actually putting bristles brush heads.After asked got runaround several times , president one company agreed show us done . He led us building asked us get car . After five-minute drive parked next another , smaller structure climbed stairs . He opened door walked small room filled windows let lovely natural light.In middle room woman wearing mask . You could see eyes . She focused choosing individual bristles brushes—gracefully moving hands fingers , using scissors combs sort bristles—that ’ even notice presence . Her movements quick hard tell doing.The president company interrupted let know ’ taking photos worked . We ’ see mouth , glint eye cheerful inflection speech let us know smiling . She looked happy proud talking work responsibilities.We use extremely fast shutter speeds capture movements . Her hands danced flowed concert tools bristles sorting.The president told us takumi one important people company , even though hidden away separate building . Every bristle every brush company made passed hands.Apple cofounder Steve Jobs big fan Japan . Not visit Sony factories 1980s adopt many methods founded Apple , also captivated simplicity quality Japanese porcelain Kyoto.It , however , artisan Kyoto Steve Jobs ’ devotion , rather takumi Toyama named Yukio Shakunaga , used technique called Etchu Seto-yaki , known few.On visit Kyoto , Jobs heard exhibition Shakunaga ’ work . He immediately understood something special Shakunaga ’ porcelain . As matter fact , bought several cups , vases , plates , went back show three times week.Jobs returned Kyoto several times course life search inspiration , ended meeting Shakunaga person . It said Jobs many questions him—almost fabrication process type porcelain used.Shakunaga explained used white porcelain extracted mountains Toyama prefecture , making artist ilk familiar fabrication process porcelain objects origins mountains final form—an authentic takumi.Jobs impressed considered going Toyama see mountain Shakunaga got porcelain , thought better heard four hours train Kyoto.In interview Jobs ’ death , Shakunaga said proud work appreciated man created iPhone . He added Jobs ’ last purchase set twelve teacups . Jobs asked something special , “ new style . ” To satisfy request , Shakunaga made 150 teacups process testing new ideas . Of , chose twelve best sent Jobs family.Ever since first trip Japan , Jobs fascinated inspired country ’ artisans , engineers ( especially Sony ) , philosophy ( especially Zen ) , cuisine ( especially sushi ) .7What Japanese artisans , engineers , Zen philosophy , cuisine common ? Simplicity attention detail . It lazy simplicity sophisticated one searches new frontiers , always taking object , body mind , cuisine next level , according one ’ ikigai.As Csikszentmihalyi would say , key always meaningful challenge overcome order maintain flow.The documentary Jiro Dreams Sushi gives us another example takumi , time kitchen . Its protagonist making sushi every day eighty years , owns small sushi restaurant near Ginza subway station Tokyo . He son go every day famous Tsukiji fish market choose best fish bring back restaurant.In documentary , see one Jiro ’ apprentices learning make tamago ( thin , slightly sweet omelet ) . No matter hard tries , ’ get Jiro ’ approval . He keeps practicing years finally does.Why apprentice refuse give ? Doesn ’ get bored cooking eggs every day ? No , making sushi ikigai , too.Both Jiro son culinary artists . They ’ get bored cook—they achieve state flow . They enjoy completely kitchen ; happiness , ikigai . They ’ learned take pleasure work , lose sense time.Beyond close relationship father son , helps keep challenge going day , also work quiet , peaceful environment allows concentrate . Even receiving three-star rating Michelin , never considered opening locations expanding business . They serve ten patrons time bar small restaurant . Jiro ’ family ’ looking make money ; instead value good working conditions creating environment flow making best sushi world.Jiro , like Yukio Shakunaga , begins work “ source . ” He goes fish market find best tuna ; Shakunaga goes mountains find best porcelain . When get work , become one object creating . This unity object reach state flow takes special meaning Japan , , according Shintoism , forests , trees , objects kami ( spirit god ) within them.When someone—whether artist , engineer , chef—sets create something , responsibility use nature give “ life ” respecting nature every moment . During process , artisan becomes one object flows . An ironworker would say metal life , someone making ceramics would say clay . The Japanese skilled bringing nature technology together : man versus nature , rather union two.There say Shinto value connected nature vanishing . One harshest critics loss another artist clearly defined ikigai : Hayao Miyazaki , director animated films produced Studio Ghibli.In nearly films see humans , technology , fantasy , nature state conflict—and , end , coming together . One poignant metaphors film Spirited Away obese spirit covered trash represents pollution rivers.In Miyazaki ’ films , forests personalities , trees feelings , robots befriend birds . Considered national treasure Japanese government , Miyazaki artist capable becoming completely absorbed art . He uses cell phone late 1990s , makes entire team draw hand . He “ directs ” films rendering paper even tiniest detail , achieving flow drawing , using computer . Thanks obsession director ’ part , Studio Ghibli one studios world almost entire production process carried using traditional techniques.Those visited Studio Ghibli know fairly typical , given Sunday see solitary individual tucked away corner , hard work—a man simple clothes greet ohayo ( hello ) without looking up.Miyazaki passionate work spends many Sundays studio , enjoying state flow , putting ikigai else . Visitors know circumstances one bother Miyazaki , known quick temper—especially interrupted drawing.In 2013 , Miyazaki announced going retire . To commemorate retirement , television station NHK made documentary showing last days work . He drawing nearly every scene film . In one scene , several colleagues seen coming meeting , , drawing corner , paying attention . In another scene , shown walking work December 30 ( national holiday Japan ) opening doors Studio Ghibli spend day , drawing alone.Miyazaki ’ stop drawing . The day “ retirement , ” instead going vacation staying home , went Studio Ghibli sat draw . His colleagues put best poker faces , knowing say . One year later , announced ’ make feature films would keep drawing day died.Can someone really retire passionate ? It Japanese capacity ; artists scientists world strong , clear ikigais . They love dying day.The last thing Einstein wrote closing eyes forever formula attempted unite forces universe single theory . When died , still loved . If ’ physicist , said , would happy musician . When ’ focused physics mathematics , enjoyed playing violin . Reaching state flow working formulas playing music , two ikigais , brought endless pleasure.Many artists might seem misanthropic reclusive , really protecting time brings happiness , sometimes expense aspects lives . They outliers apply principles flow lives extreme.Another example kind artist novelist Haruki Murakami . He sees close circle friends , appears public Japan every years.Artists know important protect space , control environment , free distractions want flow ikigai.But happens , say , laundry , mow lawn , attend paperwork ? Is way make mundane tasks enjoyable ? Near Shinjuku subway station , one neural centers Tokyo , supermarket still employs elevator operators . The elevators fairly standard could easily operated customers , store prefers provide service someone holding door open , pushing button floor , bowing exit.If ask around , ’ learn one elevator operator job since 2004 . She always smiling enthusiastic work . How able enjoy job ? Doesn ’ get bored something repetitive ? On closer inspection , becomes clear elevator operator pushing buttons instead performing whole sequence movements . She begins greeting customers songlike salutation followed bow welcoming wave hand . Then presses elevator button graceful movement , though geisha offering client cup tea.Csikszentmihalyi calls microflow.We ’ bored class conference started doodling keep entertained . Or whistled painting wall . If ’ truly challenged , get bored add layer complexity amuse . Our ability turn routine tasks moments microflow , something enjoy , key happy , since tasks.Even Bill Gates washes dishes every night . He says enjoys it—that helps relax clear mind , tries little better day , following established order set rules ’ made : plates first , forks second , on.It ’ one daily moments microflow.Richard Feynman , one important physicists time , also took pleasure routine tasks . W. Daniel Hillis , one founders supercomputer manufacturer Thinking Machines , hired Feynman work development computer could handle parallel processing already world famous . He says Feynman showed first day work said , “ OK , boss , ’ assignment ? ” They ’ anything prepared , asked work certain mathematical problem . He immediately realized giving irrelevant task keep busy said , “ That sounds like bunch baloney—give something real . ” So sent nearby shop buy office supplies , completed assignment smile face . When ’ something important needed rest mind , Feynman dedicated microflowing—say , painting office walls.Weeks later , visiting Thinking Machines offices group investors declared , “ You Nobel laureate painting walls soldering circuits . ” 8Training mind get us place flow quickly . Meditation one way exercise mental muscles.There many types meditation , objective : calming mind , observing thoughts emotions , centering focus single object.The basic practice involves sitting straight back focusing breath . Anyone , feel difference one session . By fixing attention air moving nose , slow torrent thoughts clear mental horizons.The winner 1988 Olympic gold medal archery seventeen-year-old woman South Korea . When asked prepared , replied important part training meditating two hours day.If want get better reaching state flow , meditation excellent antidote smartphones notifications constantly clamoring attention.One common mistakes among people starting meditate worrying “ right , ” achieving absolute mental silence , reaching “ nirvana . ” The important thing focus journey.Since mind constant swirl thoughts , ideas , emotions , slowing “ centrifuge ” —even seconds—can help us feel rested leave us sense clarity.In fact , one things learn practice meditation worry anything flits across mental screen . The idea killing boss might flash mind , simply label thought let pass like cloud , without judging rejecting . It thought—one sixty thousand every day , according experts.Meditation generates alpha theta brain waves . For experienced meditation , waves appear right away , might take half hour beginner experience . These relaxing brain waves ones activated right fall asleep , lie sun , right taking hot bath.We carry spa us everywhere go . It ’ matter knowing get in—something anyone , bit practice.Life inherently ritualistic . We could argue humans naturally follow rituals keep us busy . In modern cultures , forced ritualistic lives pursue goal goal order seen successful . But throughout history , humans always busy . We hunting , cooking , farming , exploring , raising families—activities structured rituals keep us busy throughout days.But unusual way , rituals still permeate daily life business practices modern Japan . The main religions Japan—Confucianism , Buddhism , Shintoism—are ones rituals important absolute rules.When business Japan , process , manners , work something important final results . Whether good bad economy beyond scope book . What indisputable , though , finding flow “ ritualistic workplace ” much easier one continually stressed trying achieve unclear goals set bosses.Rituals give us clear rules objectives , help us enter state flow . When big goal front us , might feel lost overwhelmed ; rituals help us giving us process , substeps , path achieving goal . When confronted big goal , try break parts attack part one one.Focus enjoying daily rituals , using tools enter state flow . Don ’ worry outcome—it come naturally . Happiness , result . As rule thumb , remind : “ Rituals goals . ” The happiest people ones achieve . They ones spend time others state flow.After reading chapter better idea activities life make enter flow . Write piece paper , ask questions : What activities drive flow common ? Why activities drive flow ? For example , activities like ones practice alone people ? Do flow things require move body think ? In answers questions might find underlying ikigai drives life . If ’ , keep searching going deeper like spending time activities make flow . Also , try new things list makes flow similar curious . For example , photography something drives flow , could also try painting ; might even like ! Or love snowboarding never tried surfing . . .Flow mysterious . It like muscle : train , flow , closer ikigai.WHEN WE STARTED working book , ’ want research factors contribute long happy life ; wanted hear true masters art.The interviews conducted Okinawa merit chapter , section precedes provided overview life philosophies international champions longevity . We ’ talking supercentenarians—people live 110 years age more.The term coined 1970 Norris McWhirter , editor The Guinness Book World Records . Its use became widespread 1990s , appeared William Strauss Neil Howe ’ Generations . Today estimated 300 450 supercentenarians world , although age around 75 confirmed . They ’ superheroes , could see spent far time planet average life expectancy would predict.Given rise life expectancy around world , number supercentenarians might also increase . A healthy purposeful life could help us join ranks.Let ’ take look say.According Gerontology Research Group , April 2015 , oldest living person world Misao Okawa , passed away care facility Osaka , Japan , living 117 years 27 days.The daughter textile merchant , born 1898 , Spain lost colonies Cuba Philippines , United States annexed Hawaii launched Pepsi-Cola . Until 110 , woman—who lived three different centuries—cared unassisted.When specialists asked self-care routine , Misao answered simply , “ Eating sushi sleeping , ” add , tremendous thirst life . When inquired secret longevity , answered smile , “ I ask thing . ” 1Proof Japan continues factory long life : In July year Sakari Momoi passed away 112 years 150 days old . At time oldest man world , though younger fifty-seven women.Born Ecuador 1889 , María Capovilla recognized Guinness world ’ oldest person . She died pneumonia 2006 , 116 years 347 days old , leaving behind three children , twelve grandchildren , twenty great- great-great-grandchildren.She gave one last interviews age 107 , sharing memories thoughts : I ’ happy , I give thanks God , keeps going . I never thought I ’ live long , I thought I ’ die long ago . My husband , Antonio Capovilla , captain ship . He passed away 84 . We two daughters son , I many grandchildren great-grandchildren.Things better , back old days . People behaved better . We used dance , restrained ; one song I loved dancing : “ María ” Luis Alarcón . I still remember words . I also remember many prayers , say every day.I like waltz , still dance . I also still make crafts , I still things I I school.2When finished recalling past , began dance—one great passions—with energy made seem decades younger.When asked secret longevity , responded simply , “ I ’ know secret long life . The thing I I ’ never eaten meat life . I attribute . ” Born Arles , France , February 1875 , Jeanne Calment lived August 4 , 1997 , making , 122 , oldest person verified age history . She jokingly said “ competed Methuselah , ” question broke numerous records went celebrating birthdays.She died natural causes end happy life denied almost nothing . She rode bicycle turned 100 . She lived 110 , agreed move nursing home accidentally starting small fire apartment . She stopped smoking 120 , cataracts started making hard bring cigarette lips.One secrets may sense humor . As said 120th birthday , “ I see badly , I hear badly , I feel bad , everything ’ fine . ” 3Born Minnesota 1896 , Walter Breuning able see three centuries lifetime . He died Montana 2011 , natural causes ; ’ two wives fifty-year career railroad . At eighty-three retired assisted living center Montana , remained death . He second-oldest man ( verified age ) ever born United States.He gave many interviews final years , insisting longevity stemmed , among things , habit eating two meals per day working many years could . “ Your mind body . You keep busy , ” said 112th birthday , “ ’ long time . ” Back , still exercising every day.Among Breuning ’ secrets : He habit helping others , ’ afraid dying . As declared 2010 interview Associated Press , “ We ’ going die . Some people scared dying . Never afraid die . Because ’ born die . ” 4Before passing away 2011 , said told pastor ’ made deal God : If ’ going get better , time go.Born Poland 1903 , Alexander Imich chemist parapsychologist residing United States , death predecessor 2014 , became oldest man authenticated age world . Imich died shortly thereafter , June year , leaving behind long life rich experiences.Imich attributed longevity , among things , never drinking alcohol . “ It ’ though I ’ Nobel Prize , ” said upon declared world ’ oldest man . “ I never thought I ’ get old . ” When asked secret living long , answer “ I ’ know . I ’ died yet . ” 5The secret long life , however , held supercentenarians alone . There many people advanced age , though ’ made Guinness World Records , offer us inspiration ideas bringing energy meaning lives.Artists , example , carry torch ikigai instead retiring , power.Art , forms , ikigai bring happiness purpose days . Enjoying creating beauty free , something human beings access to.Hokusai , Japanese artist made woodblock prints ukiyo-e style lived 88 years , mid-eighteenth mid-nineteenth century , added postscript first edition One Hundred Views Mount Fuji:6All I produced age 70 worth counted . It age 73 I somewhat begun understand structure true nature , animals grasses , trees birds , fishes insects ; consequently 80 years age I shall made still progress ; 90 I hope penetrated mystery things ; 100 years age I reached decidedly marvelous degree , I shall 110 , I , every point every line , shall instinct life.In pages follow , ’ collected inspirational words artists interviewed Camille Sweeney New York Times.7 Of still living , none retired , still enjoy passion , plan pursue final breath , demonstrating clear purpose , one stop you.The actor Christopher Plummer , still working eighty-six , reveals dark desire shared many love profession : “ We want drop dead onstage . That would nice theatrical way go . ” 8Osamu Tezuka , father modern Japanese manga , shared feeling . Before died 1989 , last words drew one final cartoon “ Please , let work ! ” 9The eighty-six-year-old filmmaker Frederick Wiseman declared stroll Paris likes work , intensity . “ Everybody complains aches pains , friends either dead still working , ” said.10Carmen Herrera , painter entered one hundredth year , sold first canvas age eighty-nine . Today work permanent collections Tate Modern Museum Modern Art . When asked viewed future , responded , “ I always waiting finish next thing . Absurd , I know . I go day day . ” 11 “ You may grow old trembling anatomies , may lie awake night listening disorder veins , may miss love , may see world devastated evil lunatics , know honour trampled sewers baser minds . There one thing then—to learn . Learn world wags wags . That thing mind never exhaust , never alienate , never tortured , never fear distrust , never dream regretting . ” —T . H. White , The Once Future KingFor part , naturalist author Edward O. Wilson asserted , “ I feel I enough experience join addressing big questions . About ten years ago , I began reading thinking broadly questions , come going , I astonished little done . ” 12Ellsworth Kelly , artist passed away 2015 age ninety-two , assured us idea lose faculties age , part , myth , instead develop greater clarity capacity observation . “ It ’ one thing getting older , see . . . . Every day I ’ continuing see new things . That ’ new paintings . ” 13At eighty-six , architect Frank Gehry reminds us buildings take seven years “ time ’ hired ’ finished , ” 14 fact favors patient attitude regard passage time . The man responsible Guggenheim Museum Bilbao , however , knows live : “ You stay time . You ’ go backward . I think relate time ’ , keep eyes ears open , read paper , see ’ going , stay curious everything , automatically time . ” 15Because robust civil registry , many verified lived longest found United States ; however , many centenarians living remote villages countries . A peaceful life countryside seems pretty common among people watched century pass.Without question , international superstar longevity Japan , highest life expectancy country world . In addition healthy diet , explore detail , integrated health care system people go doctor regular checkups prevent disease , longevity Japan closely tied culture , see later on.The sense community , fact Japanese people make effort stay active end , key elements secret long life.If want stay busy even ’ need work , ikigai horizon , purpose guides throughout life pushes make things beauty utility community yourself.TO GET TO Ogimi , fly nearly three hours Tokyo Naha , capital Okinawa . Several months earlier contacted town council place known Village Longevity explain purpose trip intention interview oldest members community . After numerous conversations , finally got help looking able rent house outside town.One year starting project , found doorstep longest-living people world.We realized right away time seems stopped , though entire town living endless now.After two hours road Naha , ’ finally able stop worrying traffic . To left sea empty stretch beach ; right , mountainous jungle Okinawa ’ Yanbaru forests.Once Route 58 passes Nago , Orion beer—the pride Okinawa—is made , skirts coast reaches Ogimi . Every little houses stores crop narrow stretch land road base mountain.We pass small clusters houses scattered enter municipality Ogimi , town ’ really seem center . Our GPS finally guides us destination : Center Support Promotion Well-Being , housed unattractive cinderblock building right highway.We go back door , man named Taira waiting us . Beside petite , cheerful woman introduces Yuki . Two women immediately get desks show us conference room . They serve us cup green tea shikuwasa , small citrus fruit packs big nutritional punch , see later on.Taira sits across us formal suit opens large planner three-ring binder . Yuki sits next . The binder contains list town ’ residents , organized age “ club , ” moai . Taira points groups people help one another characteristic Ogimi . The moai organized around concrete objective ; function like family . Taira also tells us volunteer work , rather money , drives much happens Ogimi . Everyone offers pitch , local government takes care assigning tasks . This way , everyone useful feels like part community.Ogimi penultimate town Cape Hedo , northernmost point largest island archipelago.From top one Ogimi ’ mountains , ’ able look whole town . Almost everything green Yanbaru jungle , making us wonder nearly thirty-two hundred residents hiding . We see houses , ’ scattered little clusters near sea small valleys accessible side roads.We ’ invited eat one Ogimi ’ restaurants , arrive three tables already reserved . “ Don ’ worry , ’ go Churaumi instead . It never fills , ” says Yuki , walking back car.She ’ still driving age eighty-eight , takes great pride . Her copilot ninety-nine , also decided spend day us . We drive fast keep highway sometimes dirt asphalt . Finally reaching end jungle , last sit eat . “ I ’ really go restaurants , ” Yuki says take seats . “ Almost everything I eat comes vegetable garden , I buy fish Tanaka , ’ friend forever . ” The restaurant right sea seems like something planet Tatooine , Star Wars . The menu boasts large letters serves “ slow food ” prepared organic vegetables grown town . “ But really , ” Yuki continues , “ food least important thing . ” She extroverted , rather pretty . She likes talk role director several associations run local government . “ Food ’ help live longer , ” says , bringing lips bite diminutive confection followed meal . “ The secret smiling good time . ” There bars restaurants Ogimi , live enjoy rich social life revolves around community centers . The town divided seventeen neighborhoods , one president several people charge things like culture , festivals , social activities , longevity.Residents pay close attention last category.We ’ invited community center one seventeen neighborhoods . It old building right next one mountains Yanbaru jungle , home bunagaya , town ’ iconic sprites.Bunagaya magical creatures inhabit Yanbaru jungle near Ogimi surrounding towns . They manifest children long red hair , like hide jungle ’ gajumaru ( banyan ) trees go fishing beach.Many Okinawa ’ stories fables bunagaya sprites . They mischievous , playful , unpredictable . Locals say bunagaya love mountains , rivers , sea , trees , earth , wind , animals , want befriend , show respect nature.When arrive neighborhood ’ community center , ’ greeted group twenty people proudly proclaim , “ The youngest among us eighty-three ! ” We conduct interviews large table drinking green tea . When finish , ’ brought event space , celebrate birthdays three members group . One woman turning ninety-nine , another ninety-four , one “ young man ” reached eighty-nine.We sing songs popular village finish “ Happy Birthday ” English . The woman turning ninety-nine blows candles thanks everyone coming party . We eat homemade shikuwasa cake end dancing celebrating though birthday twentysomething.It ’ first party , last , ’ attend week village . We ’ also karaoke group seniors sing better , attend traditional festival local bands , dancers , food stands foot mountain.Celebrations seem essential part life Ogimi.We ’ invited watch game gateball , one popular sports among Okinawa ’ older residents . It involves hitting ball mallet-like stick . It low-impact sport played anywhere , good excuse move around fun group . The residents hold local competitions , age limit participants.We participate weekly game lose woman recently turned 104 . Everyone cheers , defeated look faces elicits laughter.In addition playing celebrating community , spirituality also essential happiness village ’ residents.The main religion Okinawa known Ryukyu Shinto . Ryukyu original name Okinawa archipelago , Shinto means “ path gods . ” 1 Ryukyu Shinto combines elements Chinese Taoism , Confucianism , Buddhism , Shintoism shamanistic animistic elements.According ancient faith , world populated infinite number spirits divided several types : spirits home , forest , trees , mountains . It important appease spirits rituals festivals , consecrating sacred grounds.Okinawa full sacred jungles forests , many two main kinds temples found : utaki uganju . We visited uganju , small , open-air temple adorned incense coins , next waterfall Ogimi . The utaki collection stones people go pray , supposedly , spirits gather.In Okinawa ’ religious practice , women considered spiritually superior men , whereas opposite true traditional Shintoism rest Japan . Yuta women chosen mediums communities make contact spirit realm traditional rites.Ancestor worship another important feature spiritual practice Okinawa , Japan general . The home generation ’ firstborn usually contains butsudan , small altar , used pray make offerings family ’ ancestors.Every person essence , mabui . This mabui spirit source life force . It immortal makes us are.Sometimes , mabui someone died trapped body living person . This situation requires separation ritual free mabui deceased ; often happens person dies suddenly—especially young age—and mabui want move realm dead.A mabui also passed person person physical contact . A grandmother leaves granddaughter ring transfers part mabui . Photographs also medium passing mabui among people.Looking back , days Ogimi intense relaxed—sort like lifestyle locals , always seemed busy important tasks , upon closer inspection , everything sense calm . They always pursuing ikigai , never rush.Not seem happily busy , also noticed followed principles happiness Washington Burnap stated two hundred years ago : “ The grand essentials happiness life something , something love , something hope . ” 2On last day , went buy gifts small market edge town . The things sold local vegetables , green tea , shikuwasa juice , along bottles water spring hidden Yanbaru forests , bearing labels read “ Longevity Water . ” We bought Longevity Water drank parking lot , looking sea hoping little bottles promised magic elixir would bring us health long life , would help us find ikigai .

The trick live . ” ACCORDING TO THE World Health Organization , Japan highest life expectancy world : 85 years men 87.3 years women . Moreover , highest ratio centenarians world : 520 every million people ( September 2016 ) .Source : World Health Organization , 1966 ; Japanese Ministry Health , Labor Welfare , 2004 ; U.S. Department Health Human Services/CDC , 2005The graphic , compares life expectancy Japan , province Okinawa , Sweden , United States , shows , life expectancy Japan high overall , Okinawa exceeds national average.Okinawa one areas Japan affected World War II . As result conflicts battlefield also hunger lack resources war ended , average life expectancy high 1940s 1950s . As Okinawans recovered destruction , however , came country ’ longest-living citizens.What secrets long life Japanese hold ? What Okinawa makes best best terms life expectancy ? Experts point , one thing , Okinawa province Japan without trains . Its residents walk cycle driving . It also province managed follow Japanese government ’ recommendation eating less ten grams salt per day.The mortality rate cardiovascular disease Okinawa lowest Japan , diet almost certainly lot . It coincidence “ Okinawa Diet ” often discussed around world panels nutrition.The concrete widely cited data diet Okinawa come studies Makoto Suzuki , cardiologist University Ryukyus , published seven hundred scientific articles nutrition aging Okinawa since 1970.Bradley J. Willcox D. Craig Willcox joined Makoto Suzuki ’ research team published book considered bible subject , The Okinawa Program.1 They reached following conclusions : In addition basic dietary principles , Okinawans eat fish average three times per week ; unlike parts Japan , frequently consumed meat pork , though locals eat twice per week.Along lines , Makoto Suzuki ’ studies indicate following : This brings us back 80 percent rule mentioned first chapter , concept known Japanese hara hachi bu . It ’ easy : When notice ’ almost full could little . . . stop eating ! One easy way start applying concept hara hachi bu skip dessert . Or reduce portion size . The idea still little bit hungry finish.This portion size tends much smaller Japan West . Food ’ served appetizers , main courses , dessert . Instead , ’ much common see everything presented small plates : one rice , another vegetables , bowl miso soup , something snack . Serving food many small plates makes easier avoid eating much , facilitates varied diet discussed beginning chapter.Hara hachi bu ancient practice . The twelfth-century book Zen Buddhism Zazen Youjinki recommends eating two-thirds much might want . Eating less one might want common among Buddhist temples East . Perhaps Buddhism recognized benefits limiting caloric intake nine centuries ago.Few would challenge idea . Without taking extreme malnutrition , course , eating fewer calories bodies ask seems increase longevity . The key staying healthy consuming fewer calories eating foods high nutritional value ( especially “ superfoods ” ) avoiding add overall caloric intake offer little nutritional value.The calorie restriction ’ discussing one effective ways add years life . If body regularly consumes enough , many , calories , gets lethargic starts wear , expending significant energy digestion alone.Another benefit calorie restriction reduces levels IGF-1 ( insulin-like growth factor 1 ) body . IGF-1 protein plays significant role aging process ; seems one reasons humans animals age excess protein blood.2Whether calorie restriction extend lifespan humans yet known , data increasingly indicate moderate calorie restriction adequate nutrition powerful protective effect obesity , type 2 diabetes , inflammation , hypertension , cardiovascular disease reduces metabolic risk factors associated cancer.3An alternative following 80 percent rule daily basis fast one two days week . The 5:2 ( fasting ) diet recommends two days fasting ( consuming fewer five hundred calories ) every week eating normally five days.Among many benefits , fasting helps cleanse digestive system allows rest.Antioxidants molecules slow oxidation process cells , neutralizing free radicals cause damage accelerate aging . The antioxidant power green tea , example , well known , discussed later greater length.Because rich antioxidants eaten nearly every day region , fifteen foods considered keys Okinawan vitality : Okinawans drink Sanpin-cha—a mix green tea jasmine flowers—than kind tea . The closest approximation West would jasmine tea usually comes China . A 1988 study conducted Hiroko Sho Okinawa Institute Science Technology indicates jasmine tea reduces blood cholesterol levels.4Sanpin-cha found many different forms Okinawa , even available vending machines . In addition antioxidant benefits green tea , boasts benefits jasmine , include : Okinawans drink average three cups Sanpin-cha every day.It might hard find exactly blend West , drink jasmine tea , even high-quality green tea , instead.Green tea credited centuries significant medicinal properties . Recent studies confirmed many benefits , attested importance ancient plant longevity drink often.Originally China , consumed millennia , green tea ’ make way rest world centuries ago . Unlike teas , result air-dried without fermentation , retains active elements even dried crumbled . It offers meaningful health benefits : White tea , high concentration polyphenols , may even effective aging . In fact , considered natural product greatest antioxidant power world—to extent one cup white tea might pack punch dozen glasses orange juice.In summary : Drinking green white tea every day help us reduce free radicals bodies , keeping us young longer.Shikuwasa citrus fruit par excellence Okinawa , Ogimi largest producer Japan.The fruit extremely acidic : It impossible drink shikuwasa juice without diluting first water . Its taste somewhere lime mandarin orange , bears family resemblance.Shikuwasas also contain high levels nobiletin , flavonoid rich antioxidants.All citrus fruits—grapefruits , oranges , lemons—are high nobiletin , Okinawa ’ shikuwasas forty times much oranges . Consuming nobiletin proven protect us arteriosclerosis , cancer , type 2 diabetes , obesity general.Shikuwasas also contain vitamins C B1 , beta carotene , minerals . They used many traditional dishes add flavor food , squeezed make juice . While conducting research birthday parties town ’ “ grandparents , ” served shikuwasa cake.In 2010 UK ’ Daily Mirror published list foods recommended experts combat aging . Among foods readily available West : Foods eliminated refined sugar grains , processed baked goods , prepared foods , along cow ’ milk derivatives . Following diet help feel younger slow process premature aging.STUDIES FROM THE Blue Zones suggest people live longest ones exercise rather ones move most.When visited Ogimi , Village Longevity , discovered even people eighty ninety years old still highly active . They ’ stay home looking window reading newspaper . Ogimi ’ residents walk lot , karaoke neighbors , get early morning , , soon ’ breakfast—or even before—head outside weed gardens . They ’ go gym exercise intensely , almost never stop moving course daily routines . “ Metabolism slows 90 percent 30 minutes sitting . The enzymes move bad fat arteries muscles , get burned , slow . And two hours , good cholesterol drops 20 percent . Just getting five minutes going get things going . These things simple ’ almost stupid , ” says Gavin Bradley1 2015 interview Brigid Schulte Washington Post.2 Bradley one preeminent experts subject , director international organization dedicated building awareness detrimental sitting time health.If live city , might find hard move natural healthy ways every day , turn exercises proven centuries good body.The Eastern disciplines bringing body , mind , soul balance become quite popular West , countries origin used ages promote health.Yoga—originally India , though popular Japan—and China ’ qigong tai chi , among disciplines , seek create harmony person ’ body mind face world strength , joy , serenity.They touted elixirs youth , science endorsed claim.These gentle exercises offer extraordinary health benefits , particularly appropriate older individuals harder time staying fit.Tai chi shown , among things , slow development osteoporosis Parkinson ’ disease , increase circulation , improve muscle tone flexibility . Its emotional benefits important : It great shield stress depression.You ’ need go gym hour every day run marathons . As Japanese centenarians show us , need add movement day . Practicing Eastern disciplines regular basis great way . An added benefit well-defined steps , saw chapter IV , disciplines clear rules good flow . If ’ like disciplines , feel free choose practice love makes move.In following pages ’ take look practices promote health longevity—but first , little appetizer : singularly Japanese exercise starting day.This morning warm-up around since World War II . The “ radio ” part name instructions exercise transmitted radio , today people usually movements tuned television channel Internet video demonstrating steps.One main purposes radio taiso promote spirit unity among participants . The exercises always done groups , usually schools start classes , businesses workday begins.Statistics show 30 percent Japanese practice radio taiso minutes every morning , radio taiso one thing almost everyone interviewed Ogimi common . Even residents nursing home visited dedicated least five minutes every day , though exercises wheelchairs . We joined daily practice felt refreshed rest day.When exercises done group , usually sports field large reception hall , typically involves kind loudspeaker.The exercises take five ten minutes , depending whether . They focus dynamic stretching increasing joint mobility . One iconic radio taiso exercises consists simply raising arms head bringing circular motion . It tool wake body , easy mobility workout low intensity focuses exercising many joints possible.It might seem basic , modern lives , spend days without raising arms ears . Think : arms using computers , using smartphones , reading books . One times raise hands heads reaching something cupboard closet , ancestors raising hands heads time gathering things trees . Radio taiso helps us practice basic movements body.Basic version radio taiso exercises ( 5 minutes ) .Popular Japan well West , yoga done almost anyone . Some poses even adapted pregnant women practitioners physical disabilities.Yoga comes India , developed millennia ago unite mental physical elements . The word yoga comes Sanskrit term “ yoke , ” refers crosspiece binds draft animals one another cart ’ pulling . Yoga strives unite body mind way , guiding us toward healthy lifestyle harmony world around us.The main objectives yoga : Though oriented toward similar goals , many different types yoga vary according traditions texts developed . The differences among lie , masters say , path taken summit best self.The Sun Salutation one iconic exercises hatha yoga . To , simply follow twelve basic movements : You ’ greeted sun ; ’ ready fantastic day.Also known ’ ai chi ch ’ uan ( taijiquan ) , tai chi Chinese martial art traced back hundreds years Buddhism Confucianism ; popular Japan , too.According Chinese tradition , created Taoist master martial arts practitioner Zhang Sanfeng , though Yang Luchan nineteenth century brought form rest world.Tai chi originally neijia , internal martial art , meaning goal personal growth . Focused self-defense , teaches practice defeat adversaries using least amount force possible relying agility.Tai chi , also seen means healing body mind , would go used frequently foster health inner peace . To encourage citizens active , Chinese government promoted exercise , lost original connection martial arts , becoming instead source health well-being accessible all.There different schools styles tai chi . The following best known : Despite differences , styles objectives : According master Yang Chengfu , correct practice tai chi follows ten basic principles : One best-known movements tai chi consists following form clouds exercise called Wave Hands Like Clouds . Here steps : Also known chi kung , name combines qi ( life force , energy ) gong ( work ) , indicating form works individual ’ life force . Though relatively modern , especially current name , art qigong based Tao yin , ancient art meant foster mental physical well-being.The practice began appear reports training martial arts beginning twentieth century , 1930s used hospitals . The Chinese government later popularized , done tai chi.Qigong involves static dynamic physical exercises stimulate respiration standing , seated , reclined position . There many different styles qigong , seek strengthen regenerate qi . Though movements typically gentle , practice intense.According numerous international scientific studies , qigong—like tai chi yoga—offers significant health benefits . The following stand among proven scientific research , observed Dr. Kenneth M. Sancier San Francisco ’ Qigong Institute article “ Medical Applications Qigong ” 3 : Practicing arts keeps us shape , also helps extend lives.In order practice qigong correctly , remember life energy flows whole body . We know regulate many parts : In way , whole organism prepared work together toward single goal.One qigong ’ best-known exercises series representing five elements : earth , water , wood , metal , fire . This series movements seeks balance five currents energy order improve brain organ function.There several ways movements . In case , ’ following model Professor María Isabel García Monreal Qigong Institute Barcelona.EARTHWATERWOODMETALFIRECOMPLETING THE SERIESCreated Japan early twentieth century , principally treatment arthritis , shiatsu also works energy flow application pressure thumbs palms hands . In combination stretching breathing exercises , seeks create equilibrium among different elements body.It important Tao Yin * name , imitating something , engraved jade . What important technique essence really practiced . Stretching contracting , bending lifting head , stepping , lying , resting standing , walking stepping slowly , screaming breathing—everything Tao Yin.—Ge Hong5The book Xiuzhen shishu , known West Ten Books Cultivation Perfection , dates back thirteenth century compendium materials diverse sources developing mind body.It quotes , among others , celebrated Chinese doctor essayist Sun Simiao , lived sixth century . Sun Simiao proponent technique called Six Healing Sounds , involves coordination movement , breathing , pronouncing sounds purpose bringing souls place calm.The six sounds : Xu , pronounced like “ shh ” deep sigh , associated liverHe , pronounced like “ ” yawn , associated heartSi , pronounced like “ sir ” slow exhale , associated lungsChui , pronounced like “ chwee ” forceful exhale , associated kidneysHoo , pronounced like “ , ” associated spleenXi , pronounced like “ , ” connects whole bodyThe following poem Sun Simiao offers clues live well according season . It reminds us importance breathing , suggests breathe , visualize organs associated healing sounds.In spring , breathe xu clear eyes wood aid liver.In summer , reach , heart fire peace.In fall , breathe si stabilize gather metal , keeping lungs moist.For kidneys , next , breathe chui see inner waters calm.The Triple Heater needs xi expel heat troubles.In four seasons , take deep breaths spleen process food.And , course , avoid exhaling noisily ; ’ let even ears hear you.The practice excellent help preserve divine elixir.It might feel confusing presented Eastern traditions introduced chapter . The takeaway combine physical exercise awareness breath . These two components—movement breath—help us bring consciousness line body , instead allowing mind carried away sea daily worries . Most time , aware enough breathing.What resilience ? One thing everyone clearly defined ikigai common pursue passion matter . They never give , even cards seem stacked face one hurdle another.We ’ talking resilience , concept become influential among psychologists.But resilience ’ ability persevere . As ’ see chapter , also outlook cultivate stay focused important things life rather urgent , keep carried away negative emotions.In final section chapter , ’ explore techniques go beyond resilience cultivate antifragility.Sooner later , face difficult moments , way make huge difference quality life . Proper training mind , body , emotional resilience essential confronting life ’ ups downs.Nana korobi ya oki 七転び八起きFall seven times , rise eight.—Japanese proverbResilience ability deal setbacks . The resilient , easier pick get back gives meaning lives.Resilient people know stay focused objectives , matters , without giving discouragement . Their flexibility source strength : They know adapt change reversals fortune . They concentrate things control ’ worry ’ t.In words famous Serenity Prayer Reinhold Niebuhr : God , give us grace accept serenitythe things changed , Courage change thingswhich changed , Wisdom distinguishthe one other.Siddhārtha Gautama ( Buddha ) born prince Kapilavastu , Nepal , grew palace , surrounded riches . At sixteen married child.Not satisfied family ’ wealth , twenty-nine decided try different lifestyle ran away palace live ascetic . But ’ asceticism looking ; ’ offer happiness well-being sought . Neither wealth extreme asceticism worked . He realized wise person ignore life ’ pleasures . A wise person live pleasures always remain conscious easy enslaved them.Zeno Citium began studies Cynics . The Cynics also led ascetic lives , leaving behind earthly pleasures . They lived street , thing owned clothing backs.Seeing Cynicism give sense well-being , Zeno abandoned teachings found school Stoicism , centers idea nothing wrong enjoying life ’ pleasures long take control life enjoy . You prepared pleasures disappear.The goal eliminate feelings pleasures lives , Cynicism , eliminate negative emotions.Since inception , one objectives Buddhism Stoicism control pleasure , emotions , desires . Though philosophies different , aim curb ego control negative emotions.Both Stoicism Buddhism , roots , methods practicing well-being.According Stoicism , pleasures desires problem . We enjoy long ’ take control us . The Stoics viewed able control emotions virtuous.We finally land dream job , little already hunting better one . We win lottery buy nice car decide ’ live without sailboat . We finally win heart man woman ’ pining suddenly find wandering eye.People insatiable.The Stoics believed kinds desires ambitions worth pursuing . The objective virtuous person reach state tranquility ( apatheia ) : absence negative feelings anxiety , fear , shame , vanity , anger , presence positive feelings happiness , love , serenity , gratitude.In order keep minds virtuous , Stoics practiced something like negative visualization : They imagined worst thing could happen order prepared certain privileges pleasures taken them.To practice negative visualization , reflect negative events , without worrying them.Seneca , one richest men ancient Rome , lived life luxury , nonetheless , active Stoic . He recommended practicing negative visualization every night falling asleep . In fact , imagined negative situations , actually put practice—for example , living week without servants , food drink used wealthy man . As result , able answer question “ What ’ worst thing could happen ? ” In addition negative visualization giving negative emotions , another central tenet Stoicism knowing control ’ , see Serenity Prayer.Worrying things beyond control accomplishes nothing . We clear sense change ’ , turn allow us resist giving negative emotions.In words Epictetus , “ It ’ happens , react matters . ” 1In Zen Buddhism , meditation way become aware desires emotions thereby free . It simply question keeping mind free thoughts instead involves observing thoughts emotions appear , without getting carried away . In way , train minds get swept anger , jealousy , resentment.One commonly used mantras Buddhism focuses controlling negative emotions : “ Oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ , ” oṃ generosity purifies ego , ethics purifies jealousy , ṇi patience purifies passion desire , pad precision purifies bias , surrender purifies greed , hūṃ wisdom purifies hatred.Another key cultivating resilience knowing time live . Both Buddhism Stoicism remind us present exists , thing control . Instead worrying past future , appreciate things moment , . “ The moment truly alive present moment , ” observes Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh.In addition living , Stoics recommend reflecting impermanence things around us.The Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius said things love like leaves tree : They fall moment gust wind . He also said changes world around us accidental rather form part essence universe—a rather Buddhist notion , fact.We never forget everything people love disappear point . This something keep mind , without giving pessimism . Being aware impermanence things make us sad ; help us love present moment surround us . “ All things human short-lived perishable , ” Seneca tells us.2The temporary , ephemeral , impermanent nature world central every Buddhist discipline . Keeping always mind helps us avoid excessive pain times loss.Wabi-sabi Japanese concept shows us beauty fleeting , changeable , imperfect nature world around us . Instead searching beauty perfection , look things flawed , incomplete.This Japanese place value , example , irregular cracked teacup . Only things imperfect , incomplete , ephemeral truly beautiful , things resemble natural world.A complementary Japanese concept ichi-go ichi-e , could translated “ This moment exists ’ come . ” It heard often social gatherings reminder encounter—whether friends , family , strangers—is unique never repeated , meaning enjoy moment lose worries past future.The concept commonly used tea ceremonies , Zen meditation , Japanese martial arts , place emphasis present moment.In West , ’ grown accustomed permanence stone buildings cathedrals Europe , sometimes gives us sense nothing changes , making us forget passage time . Greco-Roman architecture adores symmetry , sharp lines , imposing facades , buildings statues gods outlast centuries.Japanese architecture , hand , ’ try imposing perfect , built spirit wabi-sabi . The tradition making structures wood presupposes impermanence need future generations rebuild . Japanese culture accepts fleeting nature human everything create.The Grand Shrine Ise,3 example , rebuilt every twenty years centuries . The important thing keep building standing generations , preserve customs traditions—things withstand passage time better structures made human hands.The key accept certain things control , like passage time ephemeral nature world around us.Ichi-go ichi-e teaches us focus present enjoy moment life brings us . This important find pursue ikigai.Wabi-sabi teaches us appreciate beauty imperfection opportunity growth.As legend goes , first time Hercules faced Hydra , despaired discovered cutting one heads meant two would grow back place . He would never able kill beast got stronger every wound.As Nassim Nicholas Taleb explains Antifragile : Things That Gain Disorder,4 use word fragile describe people , things , organizations weakened harmed , words robust resilient things able withstand harm without weakening , ’ word things get stronger harmed ( point ) .To refer kind power possessed Hydra Lerna , talk things get stronger harmed , Taleb proposes term antifragile : “ Antifragility beyond resilience robustness . The resilient resists shocks stays ; antifragile gets better . ” Catastrophes exceptional circumstances offer good models explaining antifragility . In 2011 tsunami hit Tōhoku region Japan , tremendous damage dozens cities towns along coast , famously Fukushima.When visited affected coast two years catastrophe , driven hours along cracked highways past one empty gas station another , passed several ghost towns whose streets taken remnants houses , piles cars , empty train stations . These towns fragile spaces forgotten government could recover own.Other places , Ishinomaki Kesennuma , suffered extensive damage rebuilt within years , thanks efforts many . Ishinomaki Kesennuma showed resilient ability return normal catastrophe.The earthquake caused tsunami also affected Fukushima nuclear power plant . The Tokyo Electric Power Company engineers working plant prepared recover kind damage . The Fukushima nuclear facility still state emergency decades come . It demonstrated fragility face unprecedented catastrophe.The Japanese financial markets closed minutes earthquake . Which businesses best aftermath ? Stock big construction companies steadily rise since 2011 ; need rebuild entire coast Tōhoku boon construction . In case , Japanese construction companies antifragile , since benefited enormously catastrophe.Now let ’ take look apply concept daily lives . How antifragile ? Instead single salary , try find way make money hobbies , jobs , starting business . If one salary , might left nothing employer run trouble , leaving position fragility . On hand , several options lose primary job , might happen end dedicating time secondary job , maybe even make money . You would beaten stroke bad luck would , case , antifragile.One hundred percent seniors interviewed Ogimi primary secondary occupation . Most kept vegetable garden secondary job , sold produce local market.The idea goes friendships personal interests . It ’ matter , saying goes , putting eggs one basket.In sphere romantic relationships , focus energy partner make whole world . Those people lose everything relationship ’ work , whereas ’ cultivated strong friendships full life along way , ’ better position move end relationship . They ’ antifragile.Right might thinking , “ I ’ need one salary , I ’ happy friends I ’ always . Why I add anything new ? ” It might seem like waste time add variation lives , extraordinary things ’ ordinarily happen . We slip comfort zone . But unexpected always happens , sooner later.The world finance turns useful explaining concept . If $ 10,000 saved , might put $ 9,000 index fund fixed-term deposit , invest remaining $ 1,000 ten start-ups huge growth potential—say , $ 100 each.One possible scenario three companies fail ( lose $ 300 ) , value three companies goes ( lose another $ 100 $ 200 ) , value three goes ( make $ 100 $ 200 ) , value one start-ups increases twenty-fold ( make nearly $ 2,000 , maybe even ) .You still make money , even three businesses go completely belly-up . You ’ benefited damage , like Hydra.The key becoming antifragile taking small risks might lead great reward , without exposing dangers might sink us , investing $ 10,000 fund questionable reputation saw advertised newspaper.We ’ taking negative route exercise . Ask : What makes fragile ? Certain people , things , habits generate losses us make us vulnerable . Who ? When make New Year ’ resolutions , tend emphasize adding new challenges lives . It ’ great kind objective , setting “ good riddance ” goals even bigger impact . For example : To build resilience lives , ’ fear adversity , setback opportunity growth . If adopt antifragile attitude , ’ find way get stronger every blow , refining lifestyle staying focused ikigai.Taking hit two viewed either misfortune experience apply areas lives , continually make corrections set new better goals . As Taleb writes Antifragile , “ We need randomness , mess , adventures , uncertainty , self-discovery , hear traumatic episodes , things make life worth living . ” We encourage interested concept antifragility read Nassim Nicholas Taleb ’ Antifragile.Life pure imperfection , philosophy wabi-sabi teaches us , passage time shows us everything fleeting , clear sense ikigai , moment hold many possibilities seem almost like eternity.EPILOGUEMitsuo Aida one important calligraphers haikuists twentieth century . He yet another example Japanese person dedicated life specific ikigai : communicating emotions seventeen-syllable poems , using shodo calligraphy brush.Many Aida ’ haikus philosophize importance present moment , passage time . The poem reproduced could translated “ In , thing life life . ” いまここにしかないわたしのいのちあなたのいのちIn another poem , Aida writes simply , “ Here , . ” It artwork seeks evoke feelings mono aware ( melancholy appreciation ephemeral ) .いまここThe following poem touches one secrets bringing ikigai lives : “ Happiness always determined heart . ” しあわせはいつも自分の心がきめるThis last one , also Aida , means “ Keep going ; ’ change path . ” そのままでいいがなOnce discover ikigai , pursuing nurturing every day bring meaning life . The moment life purpose , achieve happy state flow , like calligrapher canvas chef , half century , still prepares sushi patrons love.Our ikigai different us , one thing common searching meaning . When spend days feeling connected meaningful us , live fully ; lose connection , feel despair.Modern life estranges us true nature , making easy us lead lives lacking meaning . Powerful forces incentives ( money , power , attention , success ) distract us daily basis ; ’ let take life.Our intuition curiosity powerful internal compasses help us connect ikigai . Follow things enjoy , get away change dislike . Be led curiosity , keep busy things fill meaning happiness . It ’ need big thing : might find meaning good parents helping neighbors.There perfect strategy connecting ikigai . But learned Okinawans worry much finding it.Life problem solved . Just remember something keeps busy love surrounded people love you.We ’ conclude journey ten rules ’ distilled wisdom long-living residents Ogimi : The authors book wish long , happy , purposeful life.Thank joining us , HÉCTOR GARCÍA AND FRANCESC MIRALLESChapter I.

But would happen technology add year life expectancy every year ? In theory , would achieve biological immortality , reached aging ’ “ escape velocity . ” Imagine sign far future number represents age death . Every year live , advance closer sign . When reach sign , die.Now imagine rabbit holding sign walking future . Every year live , rabbit half year far away . After , reach rabbit die.But rabbit could walk pace one year every year life ? You would never able catch rabbit , therefore would never die.The speed rabbit walks future technology . The advance technology knowledge bodies , faster make rabbit walk.Aging ’ escape velocity moment rabbit walks pace one year per year faster , become immortal.Researchers eye future , Ray Kurzweil Aubrey de Grey , claim ’ reach escape velocity matter decades . Other scientists less optimistic , predicting ’ reach limit , maximum age ’ able surpass , matter much technology . For example , biologists assert cells stop regenerating 120 years.There much wisdom classic saying “ mens sana corpore sano ” ( “ sound mind sound body ” ) : It reminds us mind body important , health one connected . It shown maintaining active , adaptable mind one key factors staying young.Having youthful mind also drives toward healthy lifestyle slow aging process.Just lack physical exercise negative effects bodies mood , lack mental exercise bad us causes neurons neural connections deteriorate—and , result , reduces ability react surroundings.This ’ important give brain workout.One pioneer advocating mental exercise Israeli neuroscientist Shlomo Breznitz , argues brain needs lot stimulation order stay shape . As stated interview Eduard Punset Spanish television program Redes : There tension good someone want . This people , especially older people , like things ’ always done . The problem brain develops ingrained habits , ’ need think anymore . Things get done quickly efficiently automatic pilot , often advantageous way . This creates tendency stick routines , way breaking confront brain new information.1Presented new information , brain creates new connections revitalized . This important expose change , even stepping outside comfort zone means feeling bit anxiety.The effects mental training scientifically demonstrated . According Collins Hemingway Shlomo Breznitz book Maximum Brainpower : Challenging Brain Health Wisdom , mental training beneficial many levels : “ You begin exercising brain certain task first time , ” writes . “ And first seems difficult , learn , training already working . The second time , realize ’ easier , harder , , ’ getting better . This fantastic effect person ’ mood . In , transformation affects results obtained , also self-image . ” This description “ mental workout ” might sound bit formal , simply interacting others—playing game , example—offers new stimuli helps prevent depression come solitude.Our neurons start age still twenties . This process slowed , however , intellectual activity , curiosity , desire learn . Dealing new situations , learning something new every day , playing games , interacting people seem essential antiaging strategies mind . Furthermore , positive outlook regard yield greater mental benefits.Many people seem older . Research causes premature aging shown stress lot , body wears much faster periods crisis . The American Institute Stress investigated degenerative process concluded health problems caused stress.Researchers Heidelberg University Hospital conducted study subjected young doctor job interview , made even stressful forcing solve complex math problems thirty minutes . Afterward , took blood sample . What discovered antibodies reacted stress way react pathogens , activating proteins trigger immune response . The problem response neutralizes harmful agents , also damages healthy cells , leading age prematurely.The University California conducted similar study , taking data samples thirty-nine women high levels stress due illness one children comparing samples women healthy children low levels stress . They found stress promotes cellular aging weakening cell structures known telomeres , affect cellular regeneration cells age . As study revealed , greater stress , greater degenerative effect cells.These days , people live frantic pace nearly constant state competition . At fever pitch , stress natural response information received body potentially dangerous problematic.Theoretically , useful reaction , helps us survive hostile surroundings . Over course evolution , used response deal difficult situations flee predators.The alarm goes head makes neurons activate pituitary gland , produces hormones release corticotropin , turn circulates body via sympathetic nervous system . The adrenal gland triggered release adrenaline cortisol . Adrenaline raises respiratory rate pulse prepares muscles action , getting body ready react perceived danger , cortisol increases release dopamine blood glucose , gets us “ charged ” allows us face challenges.Cave DwellersModern HumansWere relaxed time.Work time alert threats.Felt stress specific situations.Are online waiting notifications cell phones twenty-four hours day.The threats real : A predator could end lives moment.The brain associates ping cell phone e-mail notification threat predator.High doses cortisol adrenaline moments danger kept body healthy.Low doses cortisol flow constantly body , implications range health problems , including adrenal fatigue chronic fatigue syndrome.These processes , moderation , beneficial—they help us overcome challenges daily lives . Nonetheless , stress human beings subjected today clearly harmful.Stress degenerative effect time . A sustained state emergency affects neurons associated memory , well inhibiting release certain hormones , absence cause depression . Its secondary effects include irritability , insomnia , anxiety , high blood pressure.As , though challenges good keeping mind body active , adjust high-stress lifestyles order avoid premature aging bodies.Whether threats perceive real , stress easily identifiable condition causes anxiety also highly psychosomatic , affecting everything digestive system skin.This prevention important avoiding toll stress takes us—and many experts recommend practicing mindfulness.The central premise stress-reduction method focusing self : noticing responses , even conditioned habit , order fully conscious . In way , connect limit thoughts tend spiral control . “ We learn turn autopilot ’ steering us endless loop . We know people snack talking phone watching news . You ask omelet ate onion , ’ tell , ” says Roberto Alcibar , abandoned fast-paced life become certified instructor mindfulness illness threw period acute stress.One way reach state mindfulness meditation , helps filter information reaches us outside world . It also achieved breathing exercises , yoga , body scans.Achieving mindfulness involves gradual process training , bit practice learn focus mind completely , reduces stress helps us live longer.While sustained , intense stress known enemy longevity mental physical health , low levels stress shown beneficial.After observing group test subjects twenty years , Dr. Howard S. Friedman , psychology professor University California , Riverside , discovered people maintained low level stress , faced challenges put heart soul work order succeed , lived longer chose relaxed lifestyle retired earlier . From , concluded small dose stress positive thing , live low levels stress tend develop healthier habits , smoke less , drink less alcohol.2Given , surprising many supercentenarians—people live 110 more—whom ’ meet book talk lived intense lives working well old age.In Western world particular , rise sedentary behavior led numerous diseases hypertension obesity , turn affect longevity.Spending much time seated work home reduces muscular respiratory fitness also increases appetite curbs desire participate activities . Being sedentary lead hypertension , imbalanced eating , cardiovascular disease , osteoporosis , even certain kinds cancer . Recent studies shown connection lack physical activity progressive distortion telomeres immune system , ages cells , turn , organism whole.This problem life stages , among adults . Sedentary children suffer high rates obesity associated health issues risks , ’ important develop healthy active lifestyle early age.It ’ easy less sedentary ; takes bit effort changes routine . We access active lifestyle makes us feel better inside out—we add ingredients everyday habits : By making small changes , begin renew bodies minds increase life expectancy.Though age externally internally , physically mentally , one things tell us people ’ age skin , takes different textures colors according processes going beneath surface . Most make living models claim sleep nine ten hours night fashion show . This gives skin taut , wrinkle-free appearance healthy , radiant glow.Science shown sleep key antiaging tool , sleep generate melatonin , hormone occurs naturally bodies . The pineal gland produces neurotransmitter serotonin according diurnal nocturnal rhythms , plays role sleep waking cycles.A powerful antioxidant , melatonin helps us live longer , also offers following benefits : For reasons , melatonin great ally preserving youth . It noted , however , melatonin production decreases age thirty . We compensate : Experts trying determine whether artificially stimulating production melatonin might help slow aging process . . . would confirm theory already carry secret longevity within us.The mind tremendous power body quickly ages . Most doctors agree secret keeping body young keeping mind active—a key element ikigai—and caving face difficulties throughout lives.One study , conducted Yeshiva University , found people live longest two dispositional traits common : positive attitude high degree emotional awareness . In words , face challenges positive outlook able manage emotions already well way toward longevity.A stoic attitude—serenity face setback—can also help keep young , lowers anxiety stress levels stabilizes behavior . This seen greater life expectancies certain cultures unhurried , deliberate lifestyles.Many centenarians supercentenarians similar profiles : They full lives difficult times , knew approach challenges positive attitude overwhelmed obstacles faced.Alexander Imich , 2014 became world ’ oldest living man age 111 , knew good genes understood factors contributed , : “ The life live equally important longevity , ” said interview Reuters added Guinness World Records 2014.During stay Ogimi , village holds Guinness record longevity , woman turn 100 years old sang following song us mixture Japanese local dialect : To keep healthy long life , eat little everything relish , go bed early , get early , go walk.We live day serenity enjoy journey.To keep healthy long life , get well friends.Spring , summer , fall , winter , happily enjoy seasons.The secret get distracted old fingers ; fingers head back again.If keep moving fingers working , 100 yearswill come . * We use fingers turn page next chapter , look close relationship longevity discovering life ’ mission.Discover next great read !
